        <p>INTRODUCTION
            to the Second Edition</p>
        <p>Merriam-Webster's Vocabulary Builder is designed to achieve two goals: (1)
            to add a large number of words to your permanent working vocabulary, and
            (2) to teach the most useful of the classical word-building roots to help you
            continue expanding your vocabulary in the future.
        </p>
        <p>To achieve these goals, Merriam-Webster's Vocabulary Builder employs
            an original approach that takes into account how people learn and remember.
            Some vocabulary builders simply present their words in alphabetical order;
            some provide little or no discussion of the words and how to use them; and a
            few even fail to show the kinds of sentences in which the words usually
            appear. But memorizing a series of random and unrelated things can be
            difficult and time-consuming. The fact is that we tend to remember words
            easily and naturally when they appear in some meaningful context, when
            they've been shown to be useful and therefore worth remembering, and when
            they've been properly explained to us. Knowing precisely how to use a word
            is just as important as knowing what it means.
        </p>
        <p>Greek and Latin have been the sources of most of the words in the
            English language (the third principal source being the family of Germanic
            languages). All these words were added to the language long after the fall of
            the Roman empire, and more continue to be added to this day, with most new
            words&mdash;especially those in the sciences&mdash;still making use of Greek and Latin
            roots. A knowledge of Greek and Latin roots will not only help you
            remember the meanings of the words in this book but will help you guess at
            the meanings of new words that you run into elsewhere. Remember what a
            root means and you'll have at least a fighting chance of understanding a word
            in which it appears.
        </p>
        <p>The roots in this book are only a fraction of those that exist, but they
            include almost all the roots that have produced the largest number of
            common English words. All these roots (sometimes called stems) formed
            parts of Greek and Latin words. Some are shown in more than one form (for
            example, CRAC/CRAT), which means that they changed form in the original
            language, just as buy and bought are forms of the same English word.
        </p>
        <p>Each of the more than 250 roots in this book is followed by four words
            based on the root. Each group of eight words (two roots) is followed by two quizzes. Every fifth group of words is a special eight-word section which
            may contain words based on classical mythology or history, words borrowed
            directly from Greek or Latin, or other special categories of terms. Each set of
            40 words makes up a unit. Thus, the 30 units in the book discuss in detail a
            total of 1,200 words. In addition, the brief paragraphs discussing each word
            include in italics many words closely related to the main words. So mastering
            a single word (for example, compel) can increase your vocabulary by several
            words (in this case, compelling, compulsion, and compulsive).
        </p>
        <p>The words presented here aren't all on the same level of difficulty&mdash;
            some are quite simple and some are truly challenging&mdash;but the great majority
            are words that could be encountered on the SAT and similar standardized
            tests. Most of them are in the vocabularies of well-educated Americans,
            including professionals such as scientists, lawyers, professors, and doctors.
            Even the words you feel familiar with may only have a place in your
            recognition vocabulary&mdash;that is, the words you recognize when you see or
            hear them but don't actually use in your own speech and writing.
        </p>
        <p>Each main word is followed by its most common pronunciation. Any
            pronunciation symbols unfamiliar to you can be learned easily by referring to
            the Pronunciation Symbols table on page vii.
        </p>
        <p>The definition comes next. We've tried to provide only the most
            common senses or meanings of each word, in simple and straightforward
            language, and no more than two definitions of any word are given. (A more
            complete range of definitions can be found in a college dictionary such as
            Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.)
        </p>
        <p>An example sentence marked with a bullet (&bull;) follows the definition.
            This sentence by itself can indicate a great deal about the word, including the
            kind of sentence in which it often appears. It can also serve as a memory aid;
            when you meet the word in the future, you may recall the example sentence
            more easily than the definition.
        </p>
        <p>An explanatory paragraph rounds out each entry. The paragraph may do
            a number of things: It may tell you what else you need to know in order to
            use the word intelligently and correctly, when the definition and example
            sentence aren't enough. It may tell you more about the word's roots and its
            history. It may discuss additional meanings or provide additional example
            sentences. It may demonstrate the use of closely related words. And it may
            provide an informative or entertaining glimpse into a subject related to the
            word. The intention is to make you as comfortable as possible with each
            word in turn and to enable you to start using it immediately, without fear of
            embarrassment.
        </p>
        <p>The quizzes following each eight-word group, along with the review
            quizzes at the end of each unit, will test your memory. Many of them ask you
            to fill in a blank in a sentence. Others require you to identify synonyms
            (words with the same or very similar meaning) or antonyms (words with the
            opposite meaning). Perhaps most difficult are the analogies, which ask that
            you choose the word that will make the relationship between the last two
            words the same as the relationship between the first two. Thus, you may be
            asked to complete the analogy &ldquo;calculate : count :: expend : ___&rdquo; (which can
            be read as &ldquo;Calculate is to count as expend is to ___&rdquo;) by choosing one of
            four words: stretch, speculate, pay, and explode. Since calculate and count
            are nearly synonyms, you will choose a near synonym for expend, so the
            correct answer is pay.
        </p>
        <p>Studies have shown that the only way a new word will remain alive in
            your vocabulary is if it's regularly reinforced through use and through
            reading. Learn the word here and look and listen for it elsewhere; you'll
            probably find yourself running into it frequently, just as when you've bought
            a new car you soon realize how many other people own the same model.
        </p>
        <p>Carry this book in your shoulder bag or leave it on your night table.
            Whenever you find yourself with a few minutes to spare, open it to the
            beginning of a brief root group. (There's no real need to read the units in any
            particular order, since each unit is entirely self-contained. However, studying
            the book straight through from the beginning will ensure that you make
            maximum use of it.) Pick a single word or a four-word group or an eight-
            word section; study it, test yourself, and then try making up new sentences
            for each word. Be sure to pronounce every new word aloud at least once,
            along with its definition.
        </p>
        <p>Start using the words immediately. As soon as you feel confident with a
            word, start trying to work it into your writing wherever appropriate&mdash;your
            papers and reports, your diary and your poetry. An old saying goes, &ldquo;Use it
            three times and it's yours.&rdquo; That may be, but don't stop at three. Make the
            words part of your working vocabulary, the words that you can not only
            recognize when you see or hear them but that you can comfortably call on
            whenever you need them. Astonish your friends, amaze your relatives,
            astound yourself (while trying not to be too much of a show-off)&mdash;and have
            fun!</p>

        <p>BENE is Latin for &ldquo;well.&rdquo; A benefit is a good result or effect. Something
            beneficial produces good results or effects. The Latin root can be heard in
            other languages as well: &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; in Spanish is &ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;; in
            French, it's &ldquo;Bon!&rdquo;; and in Italian, just say &ldquo;Bene!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>benediction A prayer that asks for God's blessing,
            especially a prayer that concludes a worship service.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The moment the bishop had finished his benediction, she squeezed quickly
            out of her row and darted out the cathedral's side entrance.
        </p>
        <p>In benediction, the bene root is joined by another Latin root, dictio,
            &ldquo;speaking&rdquo; (see DICT), so the word's meaning becomes something like
            &ldquo;well-wishing.&rdquo; Perhaps the best-known benediction is the so-called Aaronic
            Benediction from the Bible, which begins, &ldquo;May the Lord bless you and keep
            you.&rdquo; An important section of the Catholic Mass was traditionally known as
            the Benedictus, after its first word (meaning &ldquo;blessed&rdquo;). It was St. Benedict
            who organized the first Christian monasteries; many Christians have been
            baptized Benedict in his honor, and 16 popes have taken it as their papal
            name.</p>

        <p>benefactor Someone who helps another person or group,
            especially by giving money.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; An anonymous benefactor had given $15 million to establish an ecological
            institute at the university.
        </p>
        <p>A benefactor may be involved in almost any field. One may endow a
            scholarship fund; another may give money to expand a library; still another
            may leave a generous sum to a hospital in her will. The famous benefactions
            of John D. Rockefeller included the gifts that established the University of
            Chicago, the Rockefeller Foundation, and Rockefeller University. Many
            benefactors have reported that giving away their money turned out to be the
            most rewarding thing they ever did.</p>
        <p />

    <div class="page">
        <p />
        <p>beneficiary A person or organization that benefits or
            is expected to benefit from something, especially one that receives money or
            property when someone dies.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Living in a trailer in near-poverty, she received word in the mail that her
            father had died, naming her as the sole beneficiary of his life-insurance
            policy.
        </p>
        <p>Beneficiary is often used in connection with life insurance, but it shows up in
            many other contexts as well. A college may be the beneficiary of a private
            donation. Your uncle's will may make a church his sole beneficiary, in which
            case all his money and property will go to it when he dies. A &ldquo;third-party
            beneficiary&rdquo; of a contract is a person (often a child) who the people signing
            the contract (which is usually an insurance policy or an employee-benefit
            plan) want to benefit from it. In a more general way, a small business may be
            a beneficiary of changes to the tax code, or a restaurant may be the
            beneficiary when the one across the street closes down and its whole lunch
            crowd starts coming in.</p>
        <p />

        <p>benevolence Kindness, generosity.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In those financially desperate years, the young couple was saved only by the
            benevolence of her elderly great-uncle.
        </p>
        <p>Part of benevolence comes from the Latin root meaning &ldquo;wish.&rdquo; The novels
            of Charles Dickens often include a benevolent figure who rescues the main
            characters at some point&mdash;Mr. Brownlow in Oliver Twist, Abel Magwitch in
            David Copperfield, Mr. Jarndyce in Bleak House, Ebenezer Scrooge in A
            Christmas Carol. To be benevolent, it helps to have money, but it's not
            necessary; kind assistance of a nonfinancial sort may turn out to be lifesaving
            benevolence as well.</p>

    <div class="page">
        <p />
        <p>AM comes from the Latin amare, &ldquo;to love.&rdquo; The Roman god of love was
            known by two different names, Cupid and Amor. Amiable means &ldquo;friendly or
            good-natured,&rdquo; and amigo is Spanish for &ldquo;friend.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>amicable Friendly, peaceful.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Their relations with their in-laws were generally amicable, despite some
            bickering during the holidays.
        </p>
        <p>Amicable often describes relations between two groups, or especially two
            nations&mdash;for example, the United States and Canada, which are proud of
            sharing the longest unguarded border in the world. So we often speak of an
            amicable meeting or an amicable settlement. When amicable describes more
            personal relations, it may indicate a rather formal friendliness. But it's always
            nice when two friends who've been quarreling manage to have an amicable
            conversation and to say amicable good-byes at the end.</p>

        <p>enamored Charmed or fascinated; inflamed with love.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Rebecca quickly became enamored of the town's rustic surroundings, its
            slow pace, and its eccentric characters.
        </p>
        <p>Computer hackers are always enamored of their new programs and games.
            Millions of readers have found themselves enamored with Jane Austen's
            novels. And Romeo and Juliet were, of course, utterly enamored of each
            other. But we also often use the word in negative contexts: A friend at work
            may complain that she's not enamored of the new boss, and when you start
            talking about how you're not enamored with the neighbors it may be time to
            move. (Note that both of and with are commonly used after enamored.)</p>

        <p>amorous Having or showing strong feelings of attraction or

        <p>&bull; It turned out that the amorous Congressman had gotten his girlfriend a good
            job and was paying for her apartment.
        </p>
        <p>A couple smooching on a park bench could be called amorous, or a young
            married couple who are always hugging and kissing. But the word is often
            used a bit sarcastically, as when a tabloid newspaper gets hold of some
            scandalous photos and calls the participants &ldquo;the amorous pair.&rdquo; In such
            cases, we may be encouraged to think the attraction is more physical than
            emotional.</p>

        <p>paramour A lover, often secret, not allowed by law or
            custom.

        <p>&bull; He had been coming to the house for two years before her brothers realized
            that he was actually the paramour of their shy and withdrawn sister.
        </p>
        <p>Paramour came to English from French (a language based on Latin), though
            the modern French don't use the word. Since par amour meant &ldquo;through
            love,&rdquo; it implies a relationship based solely on love, often physical love,
            rather than on social custom or ceremony. So today it tends to refer to the
            lover of a married man or woman, but may be used for any lover who isn't
            obeying the social rules.</p>

        <p>BELL comes from the Latin word meaning &ldquo;war.&rdquo; Bellona was the little-

        <p>&bull; When World War I was over, the French nobility found it impossible to
            return to their extravagant antebellum way of life.
        </p>
        <p>Even countries that win a war often end up worse off than they had been
            before, and the losers almost always do. So antebellum often summons up
            images of ease, elegance, and entertainment that disappeared in the postwar
            years. In the American South, the antebellum way of life depended on a
            social structure, based on slavery, that collapsed after the Civil War;
            Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind shows the nostalgia and bitterness
            felt by wealthy Southerners after the war more than the relief and anticipation
            experienced by those released from slavery. In Europe, World War I
            shattered the grand life of the upper classes, even in victorious France and
            Britain, and changed society hugely in the space of just four years.</p>

        <p>bellicose Warlike, aggressive, quarrelsome.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The more bellicose party always got elected whenever there was tension
            along the border and the public believed that military action would lead to
            security.
        </p>
        <p>Since bellicose describes an attitude that hopes for actual war, the word is
            generally applied to nations and their leaders. In the 20th century, it was
            commonly used to describe such figures as Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm,
            Italy's Benito Mussolini, and Japan's General Tojo, leaders who believed their
            countries had everything to gain by starting wars. The international relations
            of a nation with a bellicose foreign policy tend to be stormy and difficult, and
            bellicosity usually makes the rest of the world very uneasy.</p>

        <p>Unlike bellicose and bellicosity, the word belligerence can be used at every
            level from the personal to the global. The belligerence of Marlon Brando's
            performances as the violent Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire
            electrified the country in the 1940s and '50s. At the same time, belligerent
            speeches by leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States throughout the
            Cold War were keeping the world on edge. Belligerent is even a noun; the
            terrible war in the Congo in recent years, for example, has involved seven
            nations as belligerents.</p>

        <p>Plenty of teenagers rebel against their parents in all kinds of ways. But a
            rebellion usually involves a group. Armed rebellions are usually put down by
            a country's armed forces, or at least kept from expanding beyond a small area.
            The American War of Independence was first viewed by the British as a
            minor rebellion that would soon run its course, but this particular rebellion
            led to a full-fledged revolution&mdash;that is, the overthrow of a government.

            pacification of an area meant using armed force to drive out the enemy,
            which might be followed by bringing the local people over to our side by
            building schools and providing social services. But an army can often bring

            American pacifists. Like these groups and individuals, pacifists haven't
            always met with sympathy or understanding. Refusing to fight ever, for any
            reason, calls for strong faith in one's own moral or religious convictions,

        <p>CRIM comes from the Latin words for &ldquo;fault or crime&rdquo; or &ldquo;accusation.&rdquo; It's
            obvious where the root shows up most commonly in English. A crime is an
            act forbidden by the government, which the government itself will punish
            you for, and for which you may be branded a criminal. A crime is usually
            more serious than a tort (see TORT), a &ldquo;civil wrong&rdquo; for which the wronged
            person must himself sue if he wants to get repaid in some way.</p>

            &mdash;criminal psychology, the social setting of crime, prohibition and
            prevention, investigation and detection, capture and punishment. Thus, many
            of the people involved&mdash;legislators, social workers, probation officers,
            judges, etc.&mdash;could possibly be considered criminologists, though the word
            usually refers only to scholars and researchers.</p>

        <p>Decriminalization of various &ldquo;victimless crimes&rdquo;&mdash;crimes that don't directly
            harm others, such as private gambling and drug-taking&mdash;has been
            recommended by conservatives as well as liberals, who often claim that it
            would ease the burden on the legal system, decrease the amount of money
            flowing to criminals, and increase personal liberty. Decriminalization is not
            the same as legalization; decriminalization may still call for a small fine (like
            a traffic ticket), and may apply only to use or possession of something,

        <p>Testimony may incriminate a suspect by placing him at the scene of a crime,
            and incriminating evidence is the kind that strongly links him to it. But the
            word doesn't always refer to an actual crime. We can say, for instance, that a
            virus has been incriminated as the cause of a type of cancer, or that video
            games have been incriminated in the decline in study skills among young

        <p>Defending oneself from a verbal attack by means of a counterattack is as
            natural as physical self-defense. So a disaster often brings recriminations
            among those connected with it, and divorces and child-custody battles usually
            involve recriminations between husband and wife. An actual crime isn't
            generally involved, but it may be; when two suspects start exchanging angry
            recriminations after they've been picked up, it often leads to one of them

        <p>&bull; When her father died, she thought she would be able to avoid probate, but
            she wasn't that lucky.
        </p>
        <p>Ever since people have written wills, those wills have had to be proven
            genuine by a judge. Without a probate process, greedy acquaintances or
            relatives could write up a fake will stating that all the person's wealth
            belonged to them. To establish a will as genuine, it must generally be
            witnessed and stamped by someone officially licensed to do so (though wills
            have sometimes been approved even when they were just written on a piece
            of scrap paper, with no witnesses). Today we use probate more broadly to
            mean everything that's handled in probate court, a special court that oversees

        <p>The related verb of reprobate is reprove, which originally, as the opposite of

            Gravity is, of course, what makes things heavy, and without it there wouldn't

        <p>Gravity has a familiar physical meaning but also a nonphysical meaning&mdash;

            have a lot less gravity than they used to have. Or you can talk about a grave
            situation, as in the example sentence. But even though Shakespeare makes a
            pun on grave when a dying character talks about being buried the next day
            (&ldquo;Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man&rdquo;), the word

        </p>
        <p>&bull; The head of the committee never failed to carry herself with the gravitas she
            felt was appropriate to her office.
        </p>
        <p>This word comes to us straight from Latin. Among the Romans, gravitas was
            thought to be essential to the character and functions of any adult (male) in
            authority. Even the head of a household or a low-level official would strive
            for this important quality. We use gravitas today to identify the same solemn
            dignity in men and women, but it seems to come easier in those who are over
            60, slow-moving&mdash;and a bit overweight.</p>
        <p />
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <p />
        <p>gravitate To move or be drawn toward something, especially
            by natural tendency or as if by an invisible force.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; On hot evenings, the town's social life gravitated toward the lakefront,
            where you could stroll the long piers eating ice cream or dance at the old
            Casino.
        </p>
        <p>To gravitate is to respond, almost unconsciously, to a force that works like
            gravity to draw things steadily to it as if by their own weight. Thus, young
            people gravitate toward a role model, moths gravitate to a flame, a
            conversation might gravitate toward politics, and everyone at a party often
            gravitates to the bar.</p>
        <p />
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <p />
        <p>aggravate (1) To make (an injury, problem, etc.) more serious
            or severe. (2) To annoy or bother.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; She went back to the soccer team before the knee was completely healed,
            which naturally aggravated the injury.
        </p>
        <p>Since the grav- root means basically &ldquo;weighty or serious,&rdquo; the original
            meaning of aggravate was &ldquo;to make more serious.&rdquo; A bad relationship with
            your parents can be aggravated by marrying someone who nobody likes, for
            example, or a touchy trade relationship between two countries can be
            aggravated by their inability to agree on climate-change issues. Depression
            can be aggravated by insomnia&mdash;and insomnia can be aggravated by
            depression. But when most people use aggravate today, they employ its
            &ldquo;annoy&rdquo; sense, as in &ldquo;What really aggravates my dad is having to listen to
            that TV all day long.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>LEV comes from the Latin adjective levis, meaning &ldquo;light,&rdquo; and the verb
            levare, meaning &ldquo;to raise or lighten.&rdquo; So a lever is a bar used to lift
            something, by means of leverage. And levitation is the magician's trick in
            which a body seems to rise into the air by itself.</p>
        <p />
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <p />
        <p>alleviate To lighten, lessen, or relieve, especially physical or
            mental suffering.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Cold compresses alleviated the pain of the physical injury, but only time
            could alleviate the effect of the insult.
        </p>
        <p>Physical pain or emotional anguish, or a water shortage or traffic congestion,
            can all be alleviated by providing the appropriate remedy. But some pain or
            anguish or shortage or congestion will remain: to alleviate is not to cure.</p>

        <p>elevation (1) The height of a place. (2) The act or result of
            lifting or raising someone or something.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Her doctor is concerned about the elevation of her blood pressure since her
            last visit.
        </p>
        <p>When you're hiking, you may be interested in knowing the highest elevation
            you'll be reaching. Psychologists use the term &ldquo;mood elevation&rdquo; to mean
            improvement in a patient's depression, and some leg ailments require
            elevation of the limb, usually so that it's higher than the heart for part of each
            day. Elevation can also mean &ldquo;promotion&rdquo;; thus, a vice president may be
            elevated to president, or a captain may be elevated to admiral.</p>

        <p>cantilever A long piece of wood, metal, etc., that sticks out
            from a wall to support something above it.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The house's deck, supported by cantilevers, jutted out dramatically over the
            rocky slope, and looking over the edge made him dizzy.
        </p>
        <p>Cantilevers hold up a surface or room without themselves being supported at
            their outer end. Many outdoor balconies are cantilevered, and theater
            balconies may be as well. A cantilevered bridge may have a huge span (as
            long as 1,800 feet) built out on either side of a single large foundation pier.
            Architects sometimes use cantilevered construction to produce dramatic
            effects; Frank Lloyd Wright's &ldquo;Fallingwater&rdquo; house, which extends out over a
            rocky river, is a famous example. But the Grand Canyon's &ldquo;Skywalk&rdquo; has
            become perhaps the best-known piece of cantilevered construction in
            America.</p>

        <p>levity Lack of appropriate seriousness.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The Puritan elders tried to ban levity of all sorts from the community's
            meetings, but found it increasingly difficult to control the younger
            generation.
        </p>
        <p>Levity originally was thought to be a physical force exactly like gravity but
            pulling in the opposite direction, like the helium in a balloon. As recently as
            the 19th century, scientists were still arguing about its existence. Today levity
            refers only to lightness in manner. To stern believers of some religious faiths,
            levity is often regarded as almost sinful. But the word, like its synonym
            frivolity, now has an old-fashioned ring to it and is usually used only half-
            seriously.</p>

        <p>cicerone A guide, especially one who takes tourists to
            museums, monuments, or architectural sites and explains what is being seen.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; On Crete they sought out a highly recommended cicerone, hoping to receive
            the best possible introduction to the noteworthy historical sites.
        </p>
        <p>The Roman statesman and orator Cicero was renowned for his elegant style
            and great knowledge (and occasional long-windedness). So 18th-century
            Italians seem to have given the name cicerone to the guides who would show
            well-educated foreigners around the great cultural sites of the ancient Roman
            empire&mdash;guides who sought to be as eloquent and informed as Cicero in
            explaining the world in which he lived.</p>

        <p>hector To bully or harass by bluster or personal pressure.

        <p>&bull; He would swagger around the apartment entrance with his friends and
            hector the terrified inhabitants going in and out.
        </p>
        <p>In Homer's great Iliad, Hector was the leader of the Trojan forces, and the
            very model of nobility and honor. In the Greek war against Troy, he killed
            several great warriors before being slain by Achilles. His name began to take
            on its current meaning only after gangs of bullying young rowdies, many of
            them armed soldiers recently released from service following the end of the
            English Civil War, began terrorizing the residents of late-17th-century
            London. The gangs took such names as the Roysters, the Blades, the Bucks,
            and the Bloods, but the best-known of them was called the Hectors. The
            names Blades and Hectors may have seemed appropriate because, like Hector
            and Achilles, they often fought with swords.</p>

        <p>hedonism An attitude or way of life based on the idea that
            pleasure or happiness should be the chief goal.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In her new spirit of hedonism, she went out for a massage, picked up
            champagne and chocolate truffles, and made a date that evening with an old
            boyfriend.
        </p>
        <p>Derived from the Greek word for &ldquo;pleasure,&rdquo; hedonism over the ages has
            provided the basis for several philosophies. The ancient Epicureans and the
            19th-century Utilitarians both taught and pursued hedonistic principles. But
            although we generally use the word today when talking about immediate
            pleasures for the senses, philosophers who talk about hedonism are usually
            talking about quiet pleasures that aren't pursued in a selfish way.</p>

        <p>Nestor was another character from the Iliad, the eldest of the Greek leaders in

            wisdom and his talkativeness, both of which increased as he aged. These

        <p>spartan Marked by simplicity, avoidance of luxury, and often
            strict self-discipline or self-denial.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; When he was single, he had lived a spartan life in a tiny, undecorated
            apartment with one chair, a table, and a bed.
        </p>
        <p>In ancient times, the Greek city-state of Sparta had a reputation for the severe
            and highly disciplined way of life it enforced among its citizens, so as to keep
            them ready for war at any time. Physical training was required for both men
            and women. A boy would begin his military training at 7 and would live in
            army barracks for much of his life, even after he was married. Today, when a
            cargo ship or a remote beach resort offers &ldquo;spartan accommodations,&rdquo; some
            tourists jump at the chance for a refreshing change from the luxuries they've
            been used to&mdash;and no one worries that they'll be forced out of bed at dawn to

            last rows of the auditorium.

        <p>Stentor, like Hector, was a warrior in the Iliad, but on the Greek side. His
            unusually powerful voice (Homer calls him &ldquo;brazen-voiced&rdquo;&mdash;that is, with a
            voice like a brass instrument) made him the natural choice for delivering
            announcements and proclamations to the assembled Greek army, in an era

        <p>&bull; She bore the pain of her broken leg with such stoic patience that most of us
            had no idea she was suffering.
        </p>
        <p>The Stoics were members of a philosophical movement that first appeared in
            ancient Greece and lasted well into the Roman era. Stoicism taught that
            humans should seek to free themselves from joy, grief, and passions of all
            kinds in order to attain wisdom; its teachings thus have much in common
            with Buddhism. The great Stoics include the statesman Cicero, the
            playwright Seneca, and the emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose Meditations is
            the most famous book of Stoic philosophy. Today we admire the kind of
            stoicism that enables some people (who may never have even heard of
            Marcus Aurelius) to endure both mental and physical pain without complaint.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The ancient city of Sybaris (near modern Terranova di Sibari), founded by
            the Greeks on the toe of Italy's &ldquo;boot,&rdquo; was famous for the wealth and luxury
            of its citizens in the 6th century B.C. But the Sybarites' wealth made them
            overconfident, and when they went to war with a nearby city, they were
            defeated by a much smaller army. After the victory, their enemies diverted
            the course of the river running through Sybaris so that it destroyed the whole
            city forever.</p>

        <p>MANIA in Latin means &ldquo;madness,&rdquo; and the meaning passed over into
            English unchanged. Our word mania can mean a mental illness, or at least an
            excessive enthusiasm. We might call someone a maniac who was wild,
            violent, and mentally ill&mdash;or maybe just really enthusiastic about something.
            Too much caffeine might make you a bit manic. But the intense mood swings
            once known as manic-depressive illness are now usually called bipolar
            disorder instead.</p>

        <p>kleptomania A mental illness in which a person has a
            strong desire to steal things.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Kleptomania leads its sufferers to steal items of little value that they don't
            need anyway.
        </p>
        <p>Klepto- comes from the Greek word kleptein, &ldquo;to steal.&rdquo; Even though
            kleptomania is often the butt of jokes, it's actually a serious mental illness,
            often associated with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and
            substance abuse. Klepotomaniacs tend to be depressed, and many live lives of
            secret shame because they're afraid to seek treatment.</p>

        <p>dipsomaniac A person with an extreme and

        <p>&bull; She didn't like the word alcoholic being applied to her, and liked
            dipsomaniac even less.
        </p>
        <p>Dipsomaniac comes from the Greek noun dipsa, &ldquo;thirst,&rdquo; but thirst usually
            has nothing to do with it. Some experts distinguish between an alcoholic and
            a dipsomaniac, reserving dipsomaniac for someone involved in frequent
            episodes of binge drinking and blackouts. In any case, there are plenty of less
            respectful words for a person of similar habits: sot, lush, wino, souse, boozer,
            guzzler, tippler, tosspot, drunkard, boozehound--the list goes on and on and

        <p>megalomaniac A mental disorder marked by
            feelings of great personal power and importance.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; When the governor started calling for arming his National Guard with
            nuclear weapons, the voters finally realized they had elected a megalomaniac.
        </p>
        <p>Since the Greek root megalo- means &ldquo;large,&rdquo; someone who is
            megalomaniacal has a mental disorder marked by feelings of personal
            grandeur. Megalomania has probably afflicted many rulers throughout
            history: The Roman emperor Caligula insisted that he be worshipped as a
            living god. Joseph Stalin suffered from the paranoia that often accompanies
            megalomania, and had thousands of his countrymen executed as a result. J.-
            B. Bokassa, dictator of a small and extremely poor African nation,
            proclaimed himself emperor of the country he renamed the Central African
            Empire. And even democratically elected leaders have often acquired huge
            egos as a result of public acclaim. But megalomaniac is generally thrown
            around as an insult and rarely refers to real mental illness.</p>

        <p>egomaniac Someone who is extremely self-centered

        </p>
        <p>&bull; He's a completely unimpressive person, but that doesn't keep him from
            being an egomaniac.
        </p>
        <p>Ego is Latin for &ldquo;I,&rdquo; and in English ego usually means &ldquo;sense of self-worth.&rdquo;
            Most people's egos stay at a healthy level, but some become exaggerated.
            Egomaniacs may display a grandiose sense of self-importance, with fantasies
            about their own brilliance or beauty, intense envy of others, a lack of
            sympathy, and a need to be adored or feared. But, like megalomaniac, the
            word egomaniac is thrown around by lots of people who don't mean much
            more by it than blowhard or know-it-all.</p>

        <p>PSYCH comes from the Greek word psyche, meaning &ldquo;breath, life, soul.&rdquo;
            Psychology is the science of mind and behavior, and a psychologist treats or
            studies the mental problems of individuals and groups. Psychiatry is a branch
            of medicine that deals with mental and emotional disorders, and a
            psychiatrist (like any other doctor) may prescribe drugs to treat them.</p>

        <p>psyche Soul, personality, mind.

        <p>&bull; Analysts are constantly trying to understand the nation's psyche and why the
            U.S. often behaves so differently from other countries.
        </p>
        <p>Sometime back in the 16th century, we borrowed the word psyche directly
            from Greek into English. In Greek mythology, Psyche was a beautiful
            princess who fell in love with Eros (Cupid), god of love, and went through
            terrible trials before being allowed to marry him. The story is often
            understood to be about the soul redeeming itself through love. (To the
            Greeks, psyche also meant &ldquo;butterfly,&rdquo; which suggests how they imagined the
            soul.) In English, psyche often sounds less spiritual than soul, less intellectual
            than mind, and more private than personality.</p>

        <p>psychedelic (1) Of or relating to a drug (such as LSD) that
            produces abnormal and often extreme mental effects such as hallucinations.
            (2) Imitating the effects of psychedelic drugs.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In her only psychedelic experience, back in 1970, she had watched with
            horror as the walls began crawling with bizarrely colored creatures.
        </p>
        <p>The most famous&mdash;or notorious&mdash;of the psychedelic drugs is LSD, a
            compound that can be obtained from various mushrooms and other fungi but
            is usually created in the lab. The other well-known psychedelics are
            psilocybin (likewise obtained from fungi) and mescaline (obtained from
            peyote cactus). How psychedelics produce their effects is still fairly
            mysterious, partly because research ceased for almost 20 years because of
            their reputation, but scientists are determined to find the answers and much
            research is now under way. Psychedelics are now used to treat anxiety in
            patients with cancer, and are being tested in the treatment of such serious
            conditions as severe depression, alcoholism, and drug addiction.</p>

        <p>psychosomatic Caused by mental or emotional
            problems rather than by physical illness.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Her doctor assumed her stomach problems were psychosomatic but gave
            her some harmless medication anyway.
        </p>
        <p>Since the Greek word soma means &ldquo;body,&rdquo; psychosomatic suggests the link
            between mind and body. Since one's mental state may have an important
            effect on one's physical state, research on new medicines always involves
            giving some patients in the experiment a placebo (fake medicine), and some
            who receive the sugar pills will seem to improve. You may hear someone say
            of someone else's symptoms, &ldquo;Oh, it's probably just psychosomatic,&rdquo;
            implying that the physical pain or illness is imaginary&mdash;maybe just an
            attempt to get sympathy&mdash;and that the person could will it away if he or she
            wanted to. But this can be harsh and unfair, since, whatever the cause is, the
            pain is usually real.</p>

        <p>Many psychologists offer psychological counseling, and psychological
            counseling can usually be called psychotherapy, so many psychologists can
            be called psychotherapists. The most intense form of psychotherapy, called
            psychoanalysis, usually requires several visits a week. A competing type of
            therapy known as behavior therapy focuses on changing a person's behavior
            (often some individual habit such as stuttering, tics, or phobias) without
            looking very deeply into his or her mental state.</p>

        <p>Reception is the noun form of receive. So at a formal reception, guests are
            received or welcomed or &ldquo;taken in.&rdquo; A bad TV reception means the signal

            has met with a good critical reception. If it gets a poor reception, on the other

        <p>Since the prefix inter means &ldquo;between&rdquo; (see INTER), it's not hard to see how
            intercept was created. Arms shipments coming to a country are sometimes
            intercepted, but such interceptions can sometimes be understood as acts of
            war. In football, soccer, and basketball, players try to intercept the ball as it's
            being passed by the other team. In years gone by, letters and documents being
            carried between officers or officials were sometimes intercepted when the
            carrier was caught; today, when these communications are generally
            electronic, an intercepted e-mail isn't actually stopped, but simply read

        <p>Perceptible includes the prefix per-, meaning &ldquo;through,&rdquo; so the word refers to

            minor changes, small clues, or hints and shades of meaning that others can't

            Leeuwenhoek invented the microscope in the 17th century, he was able to see
            organisms that had been thought too infinitesimally small to exist. But today's
            electron microscope allows us to see infinitesimal aspects of matter that even
            Leeuwenhoek could not have imagined.</p>

        <p>JECT comes from jacere, the Latin verb meaning &ldquo;throw&rdquo; or &ldquo;hurl.&rdquo; To
            reject something is to throw (or push) it back; to eject something is to throw

        <p>According to its Latin roots, interject ought to mean literally &ldquo;throw
            between.&rdquo; For most of the word's history, however, the only things that have
            been interjected have been comments dropped suddenly into a conversation.
            Interjections are often humorous, and sometimes even insulting, and the best

        <p>Formed with the prefix con-, &ldquo;together,&rdquo; conjecture means literally &ldquo;to throw
            together&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to produce a theory by putting together a number of facts.
            So, for example, Columbus conjectured from his calculations that he would
            reach Asia if he sailed westward, and his later conjecture that there was a
            &ldquo;Northwest Passage&rdquo; by sea from the Atlantic to the Pacific over the North

        <p>&bull; The president has been hearing different deficit projections all week from
            the members of his economic team.
        </p>
        <p>Projection has various meanings, but what they all have in common is that
            something is sent out or forward. A movie is projected onto a screen; a
            skilled actress projects her voice out into a large theater without seeming to
            shout; and something sticking out from a wall can be called a projection. But
            the meaning we focus on here is the one used by businesses and
            governments. Most projections of this kind are estimates of a company's sales
            or profits&mdash;or of the finances of a town, state, or country&mdash;sometime in the
            future.</p>

        <p>&bull; Considering the likely range, trajectory, and accuracy of a bullet fired from
            a cheap handgun at 100 yards, the murder seemed incredible.
        </p>
        <p>Formed with part of the prefix trans-, &ldquo;across,&rdquo; trajectory means a &ldquo;hurling

            an object launched into space at a known speed can be computed precisely.
            Missiles stand a chance of hitting their target only if their trajectory has been
            plotted accurately. The word is used most often in physics and engineering,
            but not always; we can also say, for example, that the trajectory of a whole
            life may be set in a person's youth, or that a new book traces the long

        <p>TRACT comes from trahere, the Latin verb meaning &ldquo;drag or draw.&rdquo;

        <p>traction The friction that allows a moving thing to move over a

        <p>A tractor is something that pulls something else. We usually use the word for
            a piece of farm machinery, but it's also the name of the part of a big truck that
            includes the engine and the cab. Tractors get terrific traction, because of their
            powerful engines and the deep ridges on their huge wheels. A cross-country
            skier needs traction to kick herself forward, but doesn't want it to slow her
            down when she's gliding, so the bottom of the skis may have a &ldquo;fish-scale&rdquo;
            surface that permits both of these at the same time.</p>

        <p>&bull; She was forced to retract her comment about her opponent after it was
            condemned in the press.
        </p>
        <p>The prefix re- (&ldquo;back&rdquo;) gives retract the meaning of &ldquo;draw back.&rdquo; Just as a
            cat retracts its claws into its paws when they aren't being used, a public figure
            may issue a retraction in order to say that he or she no longer wants to say
            something that has just been said. But it's sometimes hard to know what a
            retraction means: Was the original statement an error or an outright lie?
            Sometimes a politician even has to retract something that everyone actually
            assumes is the truth. Thousands of citizens were forced to publicly retract
            their &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; ideas by the Soviet government in the 1930s and the Chinese
            government in the 1960s. Someone wrongly accused may demand a
            retraction from his accuser&mdash;though today it seems more likely that he'll just
            go ahead and sue.</p>

        <p>With its prefix pro-, &ldquo;forward,&rdquo; protracted usually applies to something
            drawn out forward in time. A protracted strike may cripple a company; a
            protracted rainy spell may rot the roots of vegetables; and a protracted lawsuit
            occasionally outlives the parties involved. Before the invention of the polio

        <p>deduction (1) Subtraction. (2) The reaching of a conclusion
            by reasoning.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Foretelling the future by deduction based on a political or economic theory
            has proved to be extremely difficult.
        </p>
        <p>To deduct is simply to subtract. A tax deduction is a subtraction from your
            taxable income allowed by the government for certain expenses, which will
            result in your paying lower taxes. Your insurance deductible is the amount of
            a medical bill that the insurance company makes you subtract before it starts
            to pay&mdash;in other words, the amount that will come out of your own pocket.
            But deduction also means &ldquo;reasoning,&rdquo; and particularly reasoning based on
            general principles to produce specific findings. Mathematical reasoning is
            almost always deduction, for instance, since it is based on general rules. But
            when Dr. Watson exclaims &ldquo;Brilliant deduction, my dear Holmes!&rdquo; he simply
            means &ldquo;brilliant reasoning,&rdquo; since Sherlock Holmes's solutions are based on
            specific details he has noticed rather than on general principles.</p>

            labor in a pregnant woman. Notice that induct and induction are somewhat

        <p>Words from Mythology

        <p>Apollonian Harmonious, ordered, rational, calm.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; After a century of Romantic emotion, some composers adopted a more
            Apollonian style, producing clearly patterned pieces that avoided extremes of
            all kinds.
        </p>
        <p>In Greek mythology, Apollo was the god of the sun, light, prophecy, and
            music, and the most revered of all the gods. Partly because of the writings of
            Nietzsche, we now often think of Apollo (in contrast to the god Dionysus) as
            a model of calm reason, and we may call anything with those qualities
            Apollonian. This isn't the whole story about Apollo, however; he had a
            terrible temper and could be viciously cruel when he felt like it.</p>

        <p>bacchanalian Frenzied, orgiastic.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The bacchanalian partying on graduation night resulted in three wrecked
            cars, two lawsuits by unamused parents, and more new experiences than most
            of the participants could remember the next day.
        </p>
        <p>The Roman god of drama, wine, and ecstasy, Bacchus was the focus of a
            widespread celebration, the Bacchanalia. The festivities were originally
            secret, and only initiated members could participate. There was wine in
            abundance, and participants were expected to cut loose from normal restraints
            and give in to all sorts of wild desires. Eventually the Bacchanalia became
            more public and uncontrolled, finally getting so out of hand that in 186 B.C.
            the Roman authorities had it banned. Much the same bacchanalian spirit fills
            tropical carnivals every year, including New Orleans' Mardi Gras.</p>

        <p>delphic Unclear, ambiguous, or confusing.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; All she could get from the strange old woman were a few delphic comments
            that left her more confused than ever about the missing documents.
        </p>
        <p>Delphi in Greece was the site of a temple to Apollo at which there resided an
            oracle, a woman through whom Apollo would speak, foretelling the future.
            The Greeks consulted the oracle frequently on matters both private and
            public. The prophecies were given in difficult poetry that had to be
            interpreted by priests, and even the interpretations could be hard to
            understand. When Croesus, king of Lydia, asked what would happen if he
            attacked the Persians, the oracle announced that he would destroy a great
            empire; what she didn't say was that the empire destroyed would be his own.
            Modern-day descendants of the oracle include some political commentators,
            who utter words of delphic complexity every week.</p>

        <p>Dionysian Frenzied, delirious.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Only in the tropics did such festivals become truly Dionysian, he said,
            which was why he was booking his flight to Rio.
        </p>
        <p>Dionysus was the Greek forerunner of Bacchus. He was the inventor of wine,
            which he gave to the human race. For that gift and for all the wild behavior
            that it led to, Dionysus became immensely popular, and he appears in a great
            many myths. He is often shown holding a wine goblet, with his hair full of
            vine leaves, and attended by a band of goat-footed satyrs and wild female
            spirits called maenads. In the 19th century, scholars such as Nietzsche
            claimed that the ancient world could be understood as a continuing conflict
            between the attitudes represented by Apollo (see Apollonian) and Dionysus&mdash;
            that is, between order and disorder, between moderation and excess, between
            the controlled and the ecstatic.</p>

        <p>&bull; Their grandfather was as jovial and sociable as their grandmother was quiet
            and withdrawn.
        </p>
        <p>Jove, or Jupiter, was the Roman counterpart of the Greek's Zeus, and like
            Zeus was regarded as chief among the gods. When the Romans were naming
            the planets, they gave the name Jupiter to the one that, as they may have
            already known, was the largest of all (though only the second-brightest to the
            naked eye). When the practice of astrology reached the Roman empire from
            the East, astrologers declared that those &ldquo;born under Jupiter&rdquo; were destined to
            be merry and generous, and many centuries later this would result in the
            words jovial and joviality.</p>

        <p>&bull; His mother's always mercurial temper became even more unpredictable, to
            the point where the slightest thing would trigger a violent fit.
        </p>
        <p>The god Mercury, with his winged cap and sandals, was the very symbol of
            speed, and the planet Mercury was named for him by the Romans because it
            is the fastest-moving of the planets. His name was also given to the liquid
            silver metal that skitters around on a surface so quickly and unpredictably.
            And the word mercurial seems to have come from the metal, rather than
            directly from the god (or an astrologer's view of the planet's influence).
            Mercurial people are usually bright but impulsive and changeable (and
            sometimes a bit unstable).</p>

        <p>Olympian Lofty, superior, and detached.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Now 77, he moved slowly and spoke to the younger lawyers in Olympian
            tones, but his college friends could remember when he was a brash, crazy
            risk-taker.
        </p>
        <p>The Greek gods lived high atop Mt. Olympus, which allowed them to watch
            what went on in the human realm below and intervene as they saw fit. They
            insisted on being properly worshipped by humans, but otherwise tended to
            treat the affairs of these weak and short-lived creatures almost like a sport. So
            Olympian describes someone who seems &ldquo;lofty&rdquo; and &ldquo;above it all,&rdquo; as if
            surveying a scene in which other people appear the size of ants. The Olympic
            Games were first celebrated in the 8th century B.C., at the religious site
            called Olympia (far from Mt. Olympus), and Olympian today actually most
            often refers to Olympic athletes.</p>

        <p>venereal Having to do with sexual intercourse or diseases

        </p>
        <p>&bull; In the 19th century syphilis especially was often fatal, and venereal diseases
            killed some of the greatest figures of the time.
        </p>
        <p>Venus was the Roman goddess of love, the equivalent of the Greek
            Aphrodite. Since she governed all aspects of love and desire, a word derived
            from her name was given to the diseases acquired through sexual contact.
            Most of these venereal diseases have been around for many centuries, but
            only in the 20th century did doctors devise tests to identify them or medicines
            to cure them. Today the official term is sexually transmitted disease, or STD;
            but even this name turns out to be ambiguous, since some of these diseases
            can be contracted in other ways as well.</p>

            the ambient temperature, the temperature of the surrounding air. &ldquo;Ambient
            music&rdquo; is the term used today for &ldquo;atmospheric&rdquo; background music usually
            intended for relaxation or meditation. The candlelit restaurant in the example

        <p>Ambivalent is a fairly new word, less than a hundred years old, and, not
            surprisingly, it was first used by psychologists. Since being ambivalent
            means simply having mixed feelings about some question or issue, some of
            us spend most of our lives in a state of ambivalence. We might feel
            ambivalence about accepting a high-paying job that requires us to work long
            hours, about lending money to someone we like but don't know well&mdash;or

        <p>Ambit is a rather formal term, often used by lawyers, as in, &ldquo;With this new
            legislation, tobacco now falls within the ambit of FDA regulation.&rdquo; It almost
            always refers to something abstract rather than an actual physical range. So,
            for example, an immigrant might live completely within the ambit of her
            immigrant community until she started college, where she might find herself
            in a much broader social ambit. Most of the Latin American colonies were
            established by Spain, but in the 19th century, as the U.S. became stronger and
            Spain became weaker, they began to enter the ambit of U.S. power.</p>

        <p>epilogue The final section after the main part of a book or play.

        <p>&bull; Her editor told her the book really needed an epilogue, to tell where each

        </p>
        <p>From its Greek roots, epilogue means basically &ldquo;words attached (at the end).&rdquo;
            An epilogue often somehow wraps up a story's action, as in the one for a
            famous Shakespeare play that ends, &ldquo;For never was a story of more woe /
            Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.&rdquo; In nonfiction books, we now often use
            the term afterword instead of epilogue, just as we now generally use
            foreword instead of prologue (see LOG). Movies also often have a kind of
            epilogue&mdash;maybe a scene after the exciting climax when the surviving lovers
            meet in a caf&eacute; to talk about their future. The epilogue of a musical
            composition, after all the drama is over, is called the coda (Italian for &ldquo;tail&rdquo;).</p>

        <p>epiphyte A plant that obtains its nutrients from the air and the rain
            and usually grows on another plant for support.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The strangler fig begins life as an epiphyte on a tree branch, drops its
            tendrils to take root in the ground around the trunk, and slowly covers and
            strangles the tree to death.
        </p>
        <p>Epiphytic plants are sometimes known as &ldquo;air plants&rdquo; because they seemingly
            survive on thin air. They rely on their host plants merely for physical support,
            not nourishment. Tropical epiphytes include orchids, ferns, and members of
            the pineapple family. To a newcomer in the tropical rain forest, the first sight
            of a great tree with large epiphytes hanging from every level can be eerie and
            astonishing. Familiar epiphytes of the temperate zone include lichens,
            mosses, and algae, which may grow on rocks or water without touching the
            soil.</p>

        <p>epitaph An inscription on a grave or tomb in memory of the one
            buried there.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The great architect Christopher Wren designed London's majestic St. Paul's
            Cathedral, the site of his tomb and epitaph: &ldquo;Si monumentum requiris,
            circumspice&rdquo; (&ldquo;If you seek my monument, look around you&rdquo;).
        </p>
        <p>Epitaph includes the root from the Greek word taphos, &ldquo;tomb&rdquo; or &ldquo;funeral.&rdquo;
            Traditionally, epitaph refers to a tombstone inscription, but it can also refer to
            brief memorial statements that resemble such inscriptions. One of the most
            famous is Henry Lee's epitaph for George Washington: &ldquo;First in war, first in
            peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>epithet (1) A descriptive word or phrase occurring with or in

            phrase.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; King Richard I of England earned the epithet &ldquo;Lionhearted,&rdquo; while his
            brother, King John, was given the epithet &ldquo;Lackland.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>From its Greek roots, epithet would mean something &ldquo;put on,&rdquo; or added.
            Sometimes the added name follows a given name, as in Erik the Red or Billy
            the Kid. In other cases, the epithet precedes the personal name, as in
            Mahatma (&ldquo;Great-souled&rdquo;) Gandhi. In still others, it's used in place of the
            actual name, as in El Greco (&ldquo;The Greek&rdquo;) or El Cid (&ldquo;The Lord&rdquo;). In its
            other common meaning, an epithet is a mocking or insulting name (like
            &ldquo;Lackland&rdquo; in the example sentence). When enemies are said to be &ldquo;hurling
            epithets&rdquo; at each other, it means they're exchanging angry insults.</p>

        <p>hypochondriac A person overly concerned with his
            or her own health who often suffers from delusions of physical disease.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Hercule Poirot, the detective hero of the Agatha Christie mysteries, is a
            notorious hypochondriac, always trying to protect himself from drafts.
        </p>
        <p>One disease a hypochondriac really does suffer from is hypochondria, the
            anxiety and depression that come from worrying too much about one's own
            health. Even though it's easy to joke about hypochondriacs, hypochondria is
            no joking matter for the sufferer. Somewhat surprisingly, the second part of
            hypochondria derives from chondros, the Greek word for &ldquo;cartilage.&rdquo; The
            cartilage in question is that of the sternum, or breastbone. From ancient times,
            doctors believed that certain internal organs or regions were the seat of
            various diseases, both physical and mental, and the area under the breastbone
            was thought to be the source of hypochondria.</p>

            she now realized she needed to add daily exercise as well.
        </p>
        <p>The root glyk- means &ldquo;sweet&rdquo; in Greek, so glyc shows up in the names of
            various terms referring to a sugar as a chemical ingredient, such as glycerine
            and monoglyceride. People with diabetes have difficulty controlling the sugar
            in their blood. Too little can be dangerous; its early symptoms may be as
            minor as nervousness, shaking, and sweating, but it can lead to seizures and
            unconsciousness. Luckily, it can be taken care of easily by eating or drinking
            something high in carbohydrates. Its opposite, hyperglycemia (see HYPER),
            is the main symptom of diabetes, and usually requires an injection of insulin,
            which the sufferer usually gives himself. Today many people&mdash;though not
            doctors&mdash;use hypoglycemia to mean a completely different condition, with
            some of the same milder symptoms, that doesn't involve low blood sugar.</p>

            &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; or &ldquo;base&rdquo;&mdash;that is something &ldquo;put under&rdquo; something
            else. So a
            hypothesis is something you assume to be true in order that you can use it as
            the base or basis for a line of reasoning&mdash;and any such assumption can be
            called hypothetical. So, for example, the theory that the dinosaurs became
            extinct because of a giant meteor that struck the earth near the Yucat&aacute;n
            Peninsula involves the hypothesis that such a collision would have had such
            terrible effects on the earth's climate that the great reptiles would have been
            doomed. Once a hypothesis has been thoroughly studied and researched
            without being proved wrong, it generally comes to be called a theory instead.</p>

        <p>&bull; A special weave called thermal weave traps insulating air in little pockets to
            increase the warmth of long underwear and blankets.
        </p>
        <p>In days gone by, much of the male population of the northern states in the
            cold months would wear a garment of thermal underwear covering the entire
            body, called a union suit. Union suits kept sodbusters, cowboys, and
            townsfolk alike not only warm but also itchy and a little on the smelly side
            (back when bathing once a week was considered the height of cleanliness).
            Thermal imaging is photography that captures &ldquo;heat pictures&rdquo;&mdash;rather than
            ordinary light pictures&mdash;of objects. And thermal pollution occurs when
            industrial water use ends up warming a river in a damaging way. Small-plane

        <p>&bull; With his college major in electrical engineering, he assumed it would be an
            easy step to a graduate-school concentration in thermodynamics.
        </p>
        <p>Thermodynamics (see DYNAM) is based on the fact that all forms of energy,

            with the ways in which one form of energy is converted into another, when
            one of the forms is heat. The study of thermodynamics dates from before the
            invention of the first practical steam engine&mdash;an engine that uses steam to
            produce physical power&mdash;in the 18th century. Today most of the world's
            electrical power is actually produced by steam engines, and the principal use

        <p>thermonuclear Of or relating to the changes in the

            very high temperature to begin.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In the 1950s and '60s, anxious American families built thousands of
            underground &ldquo;fallout shelters&rdquo; to protect themselves from the radiation of a
            thermonuclear blast.
        </p>
        <p>Nuclear is the adjective for nucleus, the main central part of an atom. The
            original nuclear explosives, detonated in 1945, were so-called fission bombs,
            since they relied on the fission, or splitting, of the nuclei of uranium atoms.
            But an even greater source of destructive power lay in nuclear fusion, the
            forcing together of atomic nuclei. The light and heat given off by stars such
            as the sun come from a sustained fusion&mdash;or thermonuclear&mdash;reaction deep
            within it. On earth, such thermonuclear reactions were used to develop the
            hydrogen bomb, a bomb based on a fusion reaction that merged hydrogen
            atoms to become helium atoms. The thermonuclear era, which began in 1952,
            produced bombs hundreds of times more powerful than those exploded at the
            end of World War II. Why the thermo- in thermonuclear? Because great heat
            is required to trigger the fusion process, and the trigger used is actually a
            fission bomb.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Despite its name, the British thermal unit, or BTU, may be more widely used
            in North America than in Britain. Air conditioners, furnaces, and stoves are
            generally rated by BTUs. (Though &ldquo;BTUs&rdquo; is often short for &ldquo;BTUs per
            hour&rdquo;; in air-conditioner ratings, for instance, &ldquo;BTUs&rdquo; really means &ldquo;BTUs of
            cooling capacity per hour.&rdquo;) Fuels such as natural gas and propane are also
            compared using BTUs. The BTU first appeared in 1876 and isn't part of the
            metric system&mdash;the metric unit of energy is the much smaller joule&mdash;so it
            isn't much used by scientists, but its practicality keeps it popular for
            consumer goods and fuels. A better-known heat unit is the calorie; a BTU is
            equal to about 252 calories. (Since the familiar food calorie is actually a
            kilocalorie, a BTU equals only about a quarter of a food calorie.)</p>

        </p>
        <p>&bull; As trade between countries increases, there is more need for polyglots who
            can act as negotiators.
        </p>
        <p>Polyglot contains the root glot, meaning &ldquo;language.&rdquo; It is used both as a noun
            and as an adjective. Thus, we could say that an international airport is bound
            to be polyglot, with people from all over the world speaking their native
            languages. One of history's more interesting polyglots was the Holy Roman
            Emperor Charles V, who claimed that he addressed his horse only in German,
            conversed with women in Italian and with men in French, but reserved
            Spanish (his original language) for his talks with God.</p>

            known especially for its use in photographic film. After many decades of
            development, the polymeric compounds now include polypropylene, used in
            milk crates, luggage, and hinges; polyurethane, used in paints, adhesives,
            molded items, rubbers, and foams; and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), used to
            make pipes that won't rust. And let's not forget polyester, which gave us a lot
            of uncool clothing in the 1970s but whose strength and resistance to
            corrosion have ensured that it remains an extremely useful material for all

        <p>polygraph An instrument for recording changes in several

        </p>
        <p>With its graph- root (see GRAPH), polygraph indicates that it writes out
            several different results. A polygraph's output consists of a set of squiggly
            lines on a computer screen, each indicating one function being tested. The
            functions most commonly measured are blood pressure, breathing rate, pulse,
            and perspiration, all of which tend to increase when you lie. Polygraphs have
            been in use since 1924, and have gotten more sensitive over the years, though
            many experts still believe that they're unreliable and that a prepared liar can
            fool the machine. They're used not only for law enforcement but perhaps
            more often by employers&mdash;often the police department itself!&mdash;who don't

        <p>PRIM comes from primus, the Latin word for &ldquo;first.&rdquo; Something primary is
            first in time, rank, or importance. Something primitive is in its first stage of
            development. And something primeval had its origin in the first period of

            at night and dropping off to sleep in front of the fire.
        </p>
        <p>Primal generally describes something powerful and almost instinctual. So
            when we speak of the primal innocence of youth or the primal intensity of
            someone's devotion, we're suggesting that the emotions or conditions being
            described are basic to our animal nature. Sitting around a campfire may feel
            like a primal experience, in which we share the emotions of our cave-
            dwelling ancestors. Intense fear of snakes or spiders may have primal roots,
            owing to the poison that some species carry. In &ldquo;primal scream&rdquo; therapy,
            popular in the 1970s, patients relive painful childhood experiences and
            express their frustration and anger through uncontrolled screaming and even
            violence.</p>

        <p>Primers were once a standard part of every child's education. The first primer
            printed in North America, The New England Primer (ca. 1690), was typical;
            it contained many quotations from the Bible and many moral lessons, and the
            text was accompanied by numerous woodcut illustrations. We no longer use
            the word in early education, but it's widely used in everyday speech. Notice
            how primer is pronounced; don't mix it up with the kind of paint that's

        <p>primate Any member of the group of animals that includes

        <p>&bull; Dr. Leakey sent three young women to work with individual primates: Jane
            Goodall with the chimpanzees, Dian Fossey with the gorillas, and Birute
            Galdakis with the orangutans.
        </p>
        <p>It was the great biologist Carolus Linnaeus who gave the primates their name,
            to indicate that animals of this order were the most advanced of all. Linnaeus
            listed human beings with the apes a hundred years before Charles Darwin
            would publish his famous work on evolution. When people told him that our
            close relationship to the apes and monkeys was impossible because it
            disagreed with the Bible, he responded that, from the biological evidence, he
            simply couldn't come to a different conclusion. Among the mammals, the
            primates are distinguished by their large brains, weak sense of smell, lack of
            claws, long pregnancies, and long childhoods, among other things. Along
            with the apes and monkey, the Primate order includes such interesting
            animals as the lemurs, tarsiers, galagos, and lorises.</p>

            cells. The substance out of which the earth was formed and from which all

        <p>HOM/HOMO comes from homos, the Greek word for &ldquo;same,&rdquo; which in
            English words may also mean &ldquo;similar.&rdquo; A homograph is a word spelled like
            another word but different in meaning or pronunciation, and a homosexual is
            a person who favors others of the same sex. (This root has nothing to do with
            the Latin homo, meaning &ldquo;person,&rdquo; as in Homo sapiens, the French homme,
            and the Spanish hombre.)</p>

        <p>&bull; The pool of &ldquo;a pool of water&rdquo; and the pool of &ldquo;a game of pool&rdquo; are
            homonyms.
        </p>
        <p>Homonym can be troublesome because it may refer to three distinct classes of
            words. Homonyms may be words with identical pronunciations but different
            spellings and meanings, such as to, too, and two. Or they may be words with
            both identical pronunciations and identical spellings but different meanings,
            such as quail (the bird) and quail (to cringe). Finally, they may be words that
            are spelled alike but are different in pronunciation and meaning, such as the
            bow of a ship and bow that shoots arrows. The first and second types are
            sometimes called homophones, and the second and third types are sometimes
            called homographs&mdash;which makes naming the second type a bit confusing.
            Some language scholars prefer to limit homonym to the third type.</p>

        <p>A slab of rock is homogeneous if it consists of the same material throughout,

            find it a little boring in a neighborhood (while others find it comforting).

        <p>In his famous discussion of the panda's thumb, Stephen Jay Gould carefully
            explains how this thumb is not homologous to the human thumb. Although
            the two digits are used in much the same way (the panda's thumb is essential
            for stripping bamboo of its tasty leaves, the staple of the panda's diet), the
            panda's thumb developed from a bone in its wrist and is an addition to the
            five &ldquo;fingers&rdquo; of its paw. The tiny stirrup and anvil bones of our inner ear,
            however, do seem to be homologous with the bones that allow a garter snake

            many Americans have never seen milk with the cream on top, and probably
            think cream separation only happens in expensive yogurt. But homogenize
            was being used before anyone succeeded in getting milk and cream to mix.

        <p>The Orient is the East (just as the Occident is the West). The verb orient
            comes from the traditional practice of building Christian churches so that the
            altar is at the building's easterly end&mdash;in other words, &ldquo;orienting&rdquo; the church.
            One reason for this practice is that the Book of Matthew says, &ldquo;As the
            lightning comes from the East . . . so also will the Son of Man&rdquo;&mdash;that is, just
            like the sun in the morning, Jesus in his Second Coming will appear in the
            East. Orienteering is participating in a cross-country race in which each
            person uses a map and compass to navigate the course. Orient comes from
            the word meaning &ldquo;to rise&rdquo; (like the sun), and still today it's easy for a hiker

            witness just got out of the slammer. Many political campaigns rely on
            discrediting one's opponents; desperate politicians have learned that, if they

        <p>ad hoc Formed or used for a particular purpose or for immediate
            needs.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The faculty formed an ad hoc committee to deal with the question of First
            Amendment rights on campus.
        </p>
        <p>Ad hoc literally means &ldquo;for this&rdquo; in Latin, and in English this almost always
            means &ldquo;for this specific purpose.&rdquo; Issues that come up in the course of a
            project often require immediate, ad hoc solutions. An ad hoc investigating
            committee is authorized to look into a matter of limited scope. An ad hoc
            ruling by an athletic council is intended to settle a particular case, and is not
            meant to serve as a model for later rulings. If an organization deals with too
            many things on an ad hoc basis, it may mean someone hasn't been doing
            enough planning.</p>

        <p>ad hominem Marked by an attack on an opponent's
            character rather than by an answer to the arguments made or the issues raised.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Presidential campaigns have often relied on ad hominem attacks rather than
            serious discussion of important issues.
        </p>
        <p>Ad hominem in Latin means &ldquo;to the man&rdquo;&mdash;that is, &ldquo;against the other person.&rdquo;
            The term comes from the field of rhetoric (the art of speaking and writing). If
            you have a weak argument, one easy way to defend yourself has always been
            to attack your opponent verbally in a personal way. Since such attacks require
            neither truth nor logic to be effective, their popularity has never waned.</p>

        <p>alter ego (1) A trusted friend or personal representative. (2)
            The opposite side of a personality.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The White House chief of staff is a political alter ego, who knows, or should
            know, who and what the President considers most important.
        </p>
        <p>In Latin, alter ego literally means &ldquo;second I.&rdquo; An alter ego can be thought of
            as a person's clone or second self. A professional alter ego might be a trusted
            aide who knows exactly what the boss wants done. A personal alter ego
            might be a close friend who is almost like a twin. Alter ego can also refer to
            the second, hidden side of one's own self. In Robert Louis Stevenson's classic
            The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll is a good-
            hearted, honorable man; but after taking a potion, his alter ego, the loathsome
            and diabolical Mr. Hyde, takes over his personality.</p>

        <p>de facto Being such in practice or effect, although not formally

        </p>
        <p>&bull; Although there was never a general declaration of war, the two countries
            were at war in a de facto sense for almost a decade.
        </p>
        <p>Literally meaning &ldquo;from the fact,&rdquo; de facto in English can be applied to
            anything that has the substance of something without its formal name. A de
            facto government is one that operates with all of the power of a regular
            government but without official recognition. De facto segregation isn't the
            result of laws, but can be just as real and deep-rooted as legally enforced
            segregation. The de facto leader of a group is just the one who all the rest
            seem to follow. (Compare de jure.)</p>

        <p>quid pro quo Something given or received for something

        <p>&bull; He did something very nice for me years ago, so getting him that job was
            really a quid pro quo.
        </p>
        <p>In Latin, quid pro quo means literally &ldquo;something for something.&rdquo; Originally,
            the phrase was used to mean the substitution of an inferior medicine for a
            good one. Today it often doesn't suggest anything negative; for most people,
            it just means &ldquo;a favor for a favor.&rdquo; But in politics the phrase is often used
            when, for example, a wealthy corporation gives a lot of money to a candidate
            and expects to get a big favor in return. In such cases, some of us may prefer
            to describe the money as a bribe and the quid pro quo as a payoff.</p>

            but ex post facto excuses for impulsive behavior.
        </p>
        <p>Ex post facto is Latin for &ldquo;from a thing done afterward.&rdquo; Approval for a
            project that's given ex post facto&mdash;after the project already has been begun or
            completed&mdash;may just have been given in order to save face. An ex post facto

        <p>modus operandi A usual way of doing

        </p>
        <p>&bull; A criminal who commits repeated crimes can often be identified by his
            modus operandi.
        </p>
        <p>Modus operandi is Latin for &ldquo;method of operating.&rdquo; The term is often
            associated with police work, and it's a favorite of mystery writers. In speech
            and dialogue, it's often abbreviated to &ldquo;m.o.&rdquo; (as in &ldquo;We're beginning to get a
            handle on the killer's m.o., but we can't go public with it yet&rdquo;). But it's not
            only used in criminal contexts. So a frequent gambler who likes to play the
            horses may have a particular modus operandi for picking winners. And the
            familiar modus operandi of a cutthroat retailer may be to undersell
            competitors, drive them out of business, and then raise prices afterwards.</p>

        <p>modus vivendi (1) A practical compromise or

        </p>
        <p>&bull; During the budget crisis, the Democratic governor and the Republican
            legislature established a good working modus vivendi.
        </p>
        <p>Modus vivendi literally means &ldquo;manner of living&rdquo; in Latin, and it sometimes
            has that meaning in English as well. Usually, though, a modus vivendi is a
            working arrangement that disputing parties can live with, at least until a more
            permanent solution can be found. Typically, a modus vivendi is an
            arrangement that ignores differences and difficulties. So, for example, two
            people going through a bitter divorce may be able to arrive at a modus
            vivendi that allows them to at least maintain an appearance of civility and
            dignity.</p>

        <p>VOR comes from the Latin verb vorare, &ldquo;to eat,&rdquo; and the ending -ivorous

            carnivorous pets such as ferrets.

        <p>The order of mammals that Linnaeus named the Carnivora includes such
            families as the dogs, the bears, the raccoons, the weasels, the hyenas, the cats,
            and the seals. Most carnivores eat only meat in the wild, but some have
            varied diets; some bears, for instance, normally eat far more vegetation than
            meat. Carnivores have powerful jaws and complex teeth, and most are highly
            intelligent. Humans, like their ape cousins, are basically omnivores (see
            omnivore).</p>

        <p>Many herbivorous animals, such as rabbits, deer, sheep, and cows, are noted
            for their gentle and passive ways. But such behavior is not universal among
            herbivores. Rhinoceroses and elephants, for instance, are capable of inflicting
            serious damage if threatened, and among dinosaurs, the herbivorous
            Diplodocus had a thick tail that could be used as a lethal weapon against
            attacking carnivores. Herbivorous humans are usually called vegetarians.</p>

        <p>insectivorous Feeding on insects.

        <p>&bull; Their rather odd 12-year-old son kept insectivorous plants in his bedroom
            and fed them live flies.
        </p>
        <p>A wide variety of animals could be called insectivores&mdash;most of the birds, for
            example, as well as the spiders. Of the amphibians, frogs and many lizards
            are largely insectivorous. Even some fish get much of their food from insects.
            The order of mammals called Insectivora contains the shrews, moles, and
            hedgehogs, though bats and anteaters are also insectivores. Many insects are
            themselves insectivores; the dragonfly, for instance, is a swift insectivorous
            terror that lives up to its name. But it's the insectivorous plants that tend to
            fascinate us; of the over 600 species, the best known are the Venus flytrap
            (which snaps shut on its prey), the pitcher plants (which drown insects in a
            tiny pool of water), and the sundews (which capture insects with their sticky
            surfaces).</p>

            appetites consume large amounts of food without gaining weight.

        <p>Voracious can be applied to people, animals, and even things, and doesn't
            always refer to consuming food. Thus, teenagers are voracious eaters; you
            may become a voracious reader on vacation; and Americans have long been
            voracious consumers. The most voracious bats may eat three-quarters of their
            weight in insects in a single night. Some countries have a voracious appetite
            for oil. Voracious corporations keep &ldquo;swallowing&rdquo; other companies through

        <p>CARN comes from a Latin word meaning &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; or &ldquo;meat.&rdquo; Carnation
            originally meant &ldquo;the color of flesh,&rdquo; which was once the only color of the
            flower we call the carnation. In Christian countries, Lent is the period when
            the faithful traditionally give up something they love, often meat. The days
            leading up to Lent are known as the carnival season, from the Italian
            carnelevare, later shortened to carnevale, which meant &ldquo;removal of meat&rdquo;&mdash;
            though during carnival, of course, people indulge in just about everything,
            and the removal of meat only comes later.</p>

        <p>carnage Great destruction of life (as in a battle); slaughter.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Countries around the world appealed to all sides of the conflict to stop the
            carnage of the war in Bosnia.
        </p>
        <p>This word was taken over straight from French (a Latin-based language), and
            has mostly referred to large-scale killing in wartime. But carnage needn't
            refer only to slaughter on the battlefield. With tens of thousands of people
            dying each year in automobile accidents, it's appropriate to speak of carnage
            on the nation's highways. And those concerned about the effects of the
            violence we see constantly on TV and movie screens may refer to that as
            carnage as well.</p>

        <p>carnal Having to do with bodily pleasures.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The news stories about students on Spring Break tend to focus on the carnal
            pleasures associated with the annual ritual.
        </p>
        <p>In Christianity in past centuries, carnal was often used as the opposite of
            spiritual, describing what are sometimes called &ldquo;the pleasures of the flesh.&rdquo;
            Thus, gluttony&mdash;the consumption of excessive food and drink&mdash;was a deadly
            carnal sin, whereas the holiest monks and hermits might eat hardly anything
            and never touch wine. Today carnal has a somewhat old-fashioned sound;
            when we use it, we generally mean simply &ldquo;sexual.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>incarnate Given bodily or actual form; especially, having

        <p>&bull; For the rest of his life, he would regard his childhood nanny as goodness
            incarnate.
        </p>
        <p>Incarnate often has a religious ring to it, since for centuries it has been used
            in the Christian church, which regards Jesus as the incarnation of God&mdash;that
            is, as God made human. Surprisingly, neither word appears in Bible
            translations; instead, the Latin word incarnatus appears in the Christian
            creeds (basic statements of belief) and the Catholic Mass. Regardless,
            incarnate soon began to be used with various nouns: &ldquo;the devil incarnate,&rdquo;
            &ldquo;evil incarnate,&rdquo; etc. Notice that incarnate is one of the rare adjectives that
            usually, but not always, follows its noun. Incarnate is also a verb, though
            with a slightly different pronunciation: &ldquo;This report simply incarnates the
            prejudices of its authors,&rdquo; &ldquo;For her followers, she incarnates the virtue of
            selflessness,&rdquo; etc.</p>

        <p>reincarnation (1) Rebirth in new bodies or forms of

        <p>&bull; Even as a child he struck everyone as a reincarnation of his grandfather, not
            in his features but in his manner and personality.
        </p>
        <p>It's easy to make fun of people who claim to be the reincarnation of Cleopatra
            or Napoleon, but they don't come from a culture that takes reincarnation
            seriously. In Hindu belief, a person must pass through a series of
            reincarnations&mdash;some of which may be as insects or fish&mdash;before fully
            realizing that the bodily pleasures are shallow and that only spiritual life is
            truly valuable; only then do the reincarnations cease. For Hindus, an &ldquo;old
            soul&rdquo; is a person who seems unusually wise from early in life, and whose
            wisdom must have come from passing through many reincarnations.</p>

        <p>CRED comes from credere, the Latin verb meaning &ldquo;to believe&rdquo; or &ldquo;to
            entrust.&rdquo; We have a good credit rating when institutions trust in our ability to

            Ness monster.
        </p>
        <p>Credence is close in meaning to belief, but there are differences. Unlike
            belief, credence is seldom used in connection with faith in a religion or
            philosophy. Instead credence is often used in reference to reports, rumors,
            and opinions. And, unlike belief, it tends to be used with the words give, lack,
            lend,and gain. So a new piece of evidence may lend credence to the alibi of a
            criminal suspect. Claims that a political candidate can become the next
            President gain credence only after the candidate wins a few primaries. And
            although stories about Elvis sightings persist, they lack credence for most

        <p>Credible evidence is evidence that's likely to be believed. A credible plan is
            one that might actually work, and a credible excuse is one your parents might
            actually believe. And just as credible means &ldquo;believable,&rdquo; the noun credibility
            means &ldquo;believability.&rdquo; (But we no longer use incredible to mean the literal
            opposite of credible, just as we no longer use unbelievable as the literal
            opposite of believable.) Since cred is short for credibility, &ldquo;street cred&rdquo; is the

            Credulity is a quality of innocent children (of all ages) and isn't always a bad

            Philadelphia Phillies fans to wait so long for a World Series victory (&ldquo;This is
            the year they're going to take it!&rdquo;), which probably made life bearable for
            them. The related adjective is credulous. F. Scott Fitzgerald once defined

            written after he had lived quite a few years: &ldquo;I believe that it is better to tell
            the truth than to lie. I believe that it is better to be free than to be a slave. And

            gracefully written and somewhat personal in tone, can be a pleasure to read.

            time, and location.
        </p>
        <p>With its prefix pre-, meaning &ldquo;before,&rdquo; a precursor is literally a &ldquo;forerunner,&rdquo;
            and in fact forerunner first appeared as the translation of the Latin
            praecursor. But the two words function a little differently today. A
            forerunner may simply come before another thing, but a precursor generally
            paves the way for something. So, for example, the Office of Strategic
            Services in World War II was the immediate precursor of today's Central
            Intelligence Agency, while the blues music of the 1930s and 1940s was only
            one of the precursors of the rock and roll of today.</p>

            tetrapod. However, the two are not identical, since the tetrapod classification
            includes bipeds such as birds, in which two of the limbs are no longer used
            for walking. Insects all have six legs, of course, and in the sea there are eight-
            legged octopods (including the octopus). But there are no animals of any kind
            with an odd number of legs.</p>

        </p>
        <p>What does someone's ancestry have to do with feet? Because someone once
            thought that a family tree, or genealogical chart, resembled a crane's foot (in
            French, pied de grue), even though cranes' feet only have four talons or
            claws, no more than any other bird, while a family tree may have hundreds of
            branches. The word pedigree is usually used for purebred animals&mdash;cats,
            racehorses, and dogs, as well as livestock such as cows and sheep. Some
            people continue to believe that &ldquo;purity&rdquo; in human family trees is a good thing

            advancement.
        </p>
        <p>Impediment comes from a Latin verb that meant &ldquo;to interfere with&rdquo; or &ldquo;to get
            in the way of progress,&rdquo; as if by tripping up the feet of someone walking. In
            English, impediment still suggests an obstruction or obstacle along a path; for
            example, a lack of adequate roads and bridges would be called an
            impediment to economic development. Impediments usually get in the way of
            something we want. So we may speak of an impediment to communication,
            marriage, or progress&mdash;but something that slows the progress of aging,
            disease, or decay is rarely called an impediment.</p>

            Russians worried about such pedestrian concerns as finding enough food,
            shelter, and clothing.
        </p>
        <p>Most of us know pedestrian as a noun meaning someone who travels on foot.
            But the adjective sense of pedestrian as defined here is actually its original
            meaning. To be pedestrian was to be drab or dull, as if plodding along on foot
            rather than speeding on horseback or by coach. Pedestrian is often used to
            describe a colorless or lifeless writing style, but it can also describe
            politicians, public tastes, personal qualities, or possessions. In comparison
            with the elaborate stage shows put on by today's rock artists, for instance,
            most of the stage presentations of 1960s rock stars seem pedestrian.</p>

            nonphysical meaning may be even more common. A Hollywood actress
            might deflect criticism about her personal life by giving lavishly to charity,
            for example, and we've all tried to change the subject to deflect a question we

        <p>Genuflection, which contains the root genu-, &ldquo;knee,&rdquo; has long been a mark of

        <p>Changing the pitch, tone, or loudness of our words are ways we communicate

            indicates a statement, for example. Another way of inflecting words is by
            adding endings: -s to make a noun plural, -ed to put a verb in the past tense, -
            er to form the comparative form of an adjective, and so on.</p>

        <p>postmodern Having to do with a movement in

            elements from popular culture.

        <p>&bull; The postmodern AT&amp;T building in New York, with the &ldquo;Chippendale&rdquo; top
            that reminds viewers of an antique dresser, aroused a storm of criticism.
        </p>
        <p>With its prefix post-, postmodern describes a movement that has reacted
            against modernism. Modernism, dating from around the start of the 20th
            century, represented a sharp break from 19th-century styles. But in the 1970s
            architects began to be dissatisfied with the stark simplicity of most modern
            architecture and began including in their mostly modern designs such
            traditional elements as columns, arches, and keystones and sometimes
            startling color contrasts such as might have come from advertising and pop
            culture. In art and literature, as in architecture, postmodernism often seems to
            be making fun of tradition, especially by denying that there's any real
            distinction between serious and popular art or writing. Wherever it has shown
            up, postmodernism has been greeted with a mixture of approval, disapproval,
            and sometimes amusement.</p>

            postmortem examination of a body (often simply called a postmortem) is
            often needed to determine the time and cause of death; the stiffening called
            rigor mortis is one postmortem change that doctors look at to determine when

        <p>calypso A folk song or style of singing of West Indian origin
            that has a lively rhythm and words that are often made up by the singer.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; If you take a Caribbean vacation in December, you end up listening to a lot
            of Christmas carols played to a calypso beat.
        </p>
        <p>In Homer's Odyssey, the nymph Calypso detains Odysseus for seven years on
            his way home from the Trojan War, using all her wiles to hold him on her
            lush island. For many people, the calypso music of the West Indian islands,
            which was eventually brought to America by singers such as the Andrews
            Sisters and later Harry Belafonte, has some of the same captivating power as
            the nymph, though the lyrics that are often improvised to the melodies tend to
            make fun of local people and happenings. The original name for these songs,
            however, actually seems to be based on a similar-sounding African word, for
            which, early in the 20th century, someone began substituting this name from
            Greek mythology.</p>

        <p>Odysseus, the hero of Homer's Odyssey, spends 20 years traveling home from

            dead. Thus, an odyssey is any long, complicated journey, often a quest for a
            goal, and may be a spiritual or psychological journey as well as an actual
            voyage.</p>

        <p>palladium A precious, silver-white metal related to
            platinum that is used in electrical contacts and as an alloy with gold to form
            white gold.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Most wedding rings today are simple bands of gold, platinum, or palladium.
        </p>
        <p>Pallas Athena was one of the poetical names given to the Greek goddess
            Athena (although it's no longer clear what Pallas was supposed to mean), and
            the original palladium was a statue of Athena that was believed to have the
            power to protect the ancient city of Troy. When an asteroid belt was
            discovered between Mars and Jupiter, most of the asteroids were named after
            figures in Greek mythology, and one of the first to be discovered was named
            Pallas in 1803. In the same year, scientists isolated a new silvery metal
            element, which they named palladium in honor of the recently discovered
            asteroid.</p>

        <p>Penelope A modest domestic wife.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Critics of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 1990s would perhaps have
            preferred her to be a Penelope, quietly tending the White House and staying
            out of politics.
        </p>
        <p>In the Odyssey, Penelope waits 20 long years for her husband Odysseus to
            return from Troy. During that time, she must raise their son and fend off the
            attentions of numerous rough suitors. She preserves herself for a long time by
            saying she cannot remarry until she has finished weaving a funeral shroud for
            her aging father-in-law; however, what she weaves each day she secretly
            unravels each night. A Penelope thus appears to be the perfect, patient,
            faithful wife (and may be using her clever intelligence to keep herself that
            way).</p>

        <p>procrustean Ruthlessly disregarding individual
            differences or special circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The school's procrustean approach seemed to assume that all children
            learned in the same way and at the same rate.
        </p>
        <p>In the Greek tale of the hero Theseus, Procrustes was a bandit who ambushed
            travelers and, after robbing them, made them lie on an iron bed. To make sure
            they &ldquo;fit&rdquo; this bed, he would cut off the parts that hung off the ends or stretch
            the body if it was too short; either way, the unlucky traveler always died.
            When he made the mistake of confronting Theseus, Procrustes was made to
            &ldquo;fit&rdquo; his own bed. Something procrustean takes no account of individual
            differences but cruelly and mercilessly makes everything the same.</p>

            to play baseball, football, and basketball.
        </p>
        <p>As the story is told in the Odyssey, at the end of the Trojan War the sea god
            Proteus revealed to King Menelaus of Sparta how to get home from Troy
            with his unfaithful wife, the beautiful Helen of Troy. Before Proteus would
            give up the information, though, Menelaus had to capture him&mdash;no mean
            feat, since Proteus had the ability to change into any natural shape he chose.
            The word protean came to describe this ability to change into many different
            shapes or to play many different roles in quick succession.</p>

        <p>sibyl A female prophet or fortune-teller.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The villagers told him about an aged woman who lived alone in a hut on a
            nearby mountain, a sibyl who knew the future and would prophesy under the
            right conditions.
        </p>
        <p>Ancient writers refer to the existence of various women in such countries as
            Babylonia, Greece, Italy, and Egypt, through whom the gods regularly spoke.
            These sibyls were easy to confuse with the oracles, women who were
            likewise mouthpieces of the gods, at such sites as Apollo's temple at Delphi.
            The most famous sibyl was the Sibyl of Cumae in Italy, a withered crone who
            lived in a cave. Her prophecies were collected into twelve books, three of
            which survived to be consulted by the Romans in times of national
            emergencies. She is one of the five sibyls memorably depicted by
            Michelangelo on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.</p>

        <p>siren A woman who tempts men with bewitching sweetness.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Reporters treated her like a sex symbol, but she lacked the graceful presence
            and air of mystery of a real siren.
        </p>
        <p>The sirens were a group of partly human female creatures that lured sailors
            onto destructive rocks with their singing. Odysseus and his men encountered
            the sirens on their long journey home from Troy. The only way to sail by
            them safely was to make oneself deaf to their enchanting song, so Odysseus
            packed the men's ears with wax, while he himself, ever curious, kept his ears
            open but had himself tied to the mast to keep from flinging himself into the
            water or steering his ship toward sure destruction in his desire to see them. A
            siren today is a sinister but almost irresistible woman. A siren song, however,
            may be any appeal that lures a person to act against his or her better
            judgment.</p>

        <p>MAL comes from a Latin word meaning &ldquo;bad.&rdquo; A malady is a bad condition
            &mdash;a disease or illness&mdash;of the body or mind. Malpractice is bad medical
            practice. Malodorous things smell bad. And a malefactor is someone guilty

        <p>Malevolence runs deep. Malevolent enemies have bitter and lasting feelings
            of ill will. Malevolent racism and bigotry can erupt in acts of violence against
            innocent people. Malevolence can also show itself in hurtful words, and can
            sometimes be seen in something as small as an angry look or gesture.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Malicious and malevolent are close in meaning, since both refer to ill will that
            desires to see someone else suffer. But while malevolent suggests deep and
            lasting dislike, malicious usually means petty and spiteful. Malicious
            gossipers are often simply envious of a neighbor's good fortune. Vandals may
            take malicious pleasure in destroying and defacing property but usually don't
            truly hate the owners. Malice is an important legal concept, which has to be

            figures in British naval history.
        </p>
        <p>Malign is related to verbs like defame, slander, and libel. The person or
            group being maligned is the victim of false or misleading statements, even if
            the maligner isn't necessarily guilty of deliberate lying. Someone or
            something that's frequently criticized is often said to be &ldquo;much maligned,&rdquo;
            which suggests that the criticism isn't entirely fair or deserved. Malign is also
            an adjective, and writers often refer to a person's malign influence. The very
            similar malignant, which used to be a common synonym of malign, today
            tends to describe dangerous medical conditions, especially cancerous tumors.</p>

            a violent political revolution may also be a cataclysmic event. Many

        <p>catacomb An underground cemetery of connecting

        <p>&bull; The early Christian catacombs of Rome provide a striking glimpse into the
            ancient past for modern-day visitors.
        </p>
        <p>About forty Christian catacombs have been found near the roads that once led
            into Rome. After the decline of the Roman empire these cemeteries were
            forgotten, not to be rediscovered until 1578. Catacomb has come to refer to
            different kinds of underground chambers and passageways. The catacombs of
            Paris are abandoned stone quarries that were not used for burials until 1787.
            The catacombs built by a monastery in Palermo, Sicily, for its deceased
            members later began accepting bodies from outside the monastery; today you
            may wander through looking at hundreds of mummified corpses propped
            against the catacomb walls, dressed in tattered clothes that were once
            fashionable.</p>

        <p>catalyst (1) A substance that speeds up a chemical reaction or

            brings about or speeds significant change or action.

        <p>&bull; The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 turned out to
            be the catalyst for World War I.
        </p>
        <p>Chemical catalysts are substances that, in very small amounts, can bring
            about important chemical changes in large quantities of material. The
            catalytic converter in your car's exhaust system, for instance, uses tiny
            amounts of platinum to swiftly convert the engine's dangerous gases to
            carbon dioxide and water vapor. And it's easy to see how the meaning of
            catalyst could broaden to include nonchemical situations. We can now say,
            for example, that the Great Depression served as the catalyst for such
            important social reforms as Social Security.</p>

            schizophrenia, though it may show up in patients with a variety of other

            catatonic patients may be &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; for hours or even days in a single position.
            Its causes remain mysterious. Serious though the condition is, most
            nondoctors use catatonic humorously to describe people who seem incapable

        <p>PROT/PROTO comes from Greek and has the basic meaning &ldquo;first in time&rdquo;
            or &ldquo;first formed.&rdquo; Protozoa are one-celled animals, such as amoebas and
            paramecia, that are among the most basic members of the biological
            kingdom. A proton is an elementary particle that, along with neutrons, can be
            found in all atomic nuclei. A protoplanet is a whirling mass of gas and dust
            that astronomers believe may someday become a planet.</p>

        <p>protagonist The main character in a literary work.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Macbeth is the ruthlessly ambitious protagonist of Shakespeare's play, but it
            is his wife who pulls the strings.
        </p>
        <p>Struggle, or conflict, is central to drama. The protagonist or hero of a play,
            novel, or film is involved in a struggle of some kind, either against someone
            or something else or even against his or her own emotions. So the hero is the
            &ldquo;first struggler,&rdquo; which is the literal meaning of the Greek word pr tag nist
            s. A character who opposes the hero is the antagonist, from a Greek verb that
            means literally &ldquo;to struggle against.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>protocol (1) A code of diplomatic or military rules of

            communications system.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The guests at the governor's dinner were introduced and seated according to
            the strict protocol governing such occasions.
        </p>
        <p>The basic meaning of proto- is a little harder to follow in this word. Protocol
            comes from a Greek word for the first sheet of a papyrus roll. In English,
            protocol originally meant &ldquo;a first draft or record,&rdquo; and later specifically the
            first draft of a diplomatic document, such as a treaty. The &ldquo;diplomatic&rdquo;
            connection led eventually to its current meaning of &ldquo;rules of behavior.&rdquo;
            Someone wearing Bermuda shorts and sandals to a state dinner at the White
            House would not be acting &ldquo;according to protocol,&rdquo; and royal protocol
            forbids touching the queen of England except to shake her hand. But protocol
            is also now used for other sets of rules, such as those for doing a scientific
            experiment or for handling computer data.</p>

        <p>protoplasm The substance that makes up the living parts
            of cells.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; A mixture of organic and inorganic substances, such as protein and water,
            protoplasm is regarded as the physical basis of life.
        </p>
        <p>After the word protoplasm was coined in the mid-19th century for the
            jellylike material that is the main substance of a cell, it began to be used
            widely, especially by scientists and others who imagined that the first life-
            forms must have arisen out of a great seething protoplasmic soup. Since
            protoplasm includes all the cell's living material, inside and outside the
            nucleus, it is a less useful scientific word today than more precise terms such
            as cytoplasm, which refers only to the living material outside the nucleus. But
            many remain fascinated by the image of that soup bubbling away as the
            lightning flashes and the volcanoes erupt.</p>

        <p>prototype (1) An original model on which something is
            patterned. (2) A first, full-scale, usually working version of a new type or
            design.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; There was great excitement when, after years of top-secret development, the
            prototype of the new Stealth bomber first took to the skies.
        </p>
        <p>A prototype is someone or something that serves as a model or inspiration. A
            successful fund-raising campaign can serve as a prototype for future
            campaigns, for example, and the legendary Robin Hood is the prototypical
            honorable outlaw, the inspiration for countless other romantic heroes. But the
            term is perhaps most widely used in the world of technology; every new
            &ldquo;concept car,&rdquo; for example, starts off as a unique prototype.</p>

        <p>ANTE is Latin for &ldquo;before&rdquo; or &ldquo;in front of.&rdquo; Antediluvian, which describes

            Noah's Flood. And antebellum literally means &ldquo;before the war,&rdquo; usually the

        <p>antechamber An outer room that leads to another and is
            often used as a waiting room.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The antechamber to the lawyer's office was both elegant and comfortable,
            designed to inspire trust and confidence.
        </p>
        <p>One expects to find an antechamber outside the private chambers of a
            Supreme Court Justice or leading into the great hall of a medieval castle. In
            the private end of the castle the lord's or lady's bedchamber would have its
            own antechamber, which served as a dressing room and sitting room, but
            could also house bodyguards if the castle came under siege. Anteroom is a
            less formal synonym, one that's often applied to the waiting rooms of
            professional offices today.</p>

        <p>antedate (1) To date something (such as a check) with a date
            earlier than that of actual writing. (2) To precede in time.

        <p>&bull; Nantucket Island has hundreds of beautifully preserved houses that antedate
            the Civil War.
        </p>
        <p>Dinosaurs antedated the first human beings by almost 65 million years,
            though this stubborn fact never used to stop cartoonists and screenwriters
            from having the two species inhabit the same story line. Dictionary editors
            are constantly noticing how the oral use of a word may antedate its first
            appearance in print by a number of years. Antedating a check or a contract
            isn't illegal unless it's done for the purpose of fraud (the same is true of its
            opposite, postdating).</p>

        <p>antecedent (1) A word or phrase that is referred to by a
            pronoun that follows it. (2) An event or cause coming before something.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; As I remember, she said &ldquo;My uncle is taking my father, and he's staying
            overnight,&rdquo; but I'm not sure what the antecedent of &ldquo;he&rdquo; was.
        </p>
        <p>A basic principle of clear writing is to keep your antecedents clear. Pronouns
            are often used in order not to repeat a noun (so instead of saying &ldquo;Sheila turns
            22 tomorrow, and Sheila is having a party,&rdquo; we replace the second &ldquo;Sheila&rdquo;
            with &ldquo;she&rdquo;). But sloppy writers sometimes leave their antecedents unclear
            (for instance, &ldquo;Sheila helps Kathleen out, but she doesn't appreciate it,&rdquo; where
            it isn't clear who &ldquo;she&rdquo; is). Watch out for this possible problem when using
            not just he and she but also they, them, it, this, and that. And keep in mind
            that antecedent isn't just a grammar term. You may talk about the antecedents
            of heart disease (such as bad eating habits), the antecedents of World War II
            (such as the unwise Treaty of Versailles), and even your own antecedents
            (your mother, grandfather, etc.).</p>

        <p>anterior (1) Located before or toward the front or head. (2)
            Coming before in time or development.

        <p>&bull; When she moved up to join the first-class passengers in the plane's anterior
            section, she was delighted to recognize the governor in the next seat.
        </p>
        <p>Anterior generally appears in either medical or scholarly contexts. Anatomy
            books refer to the anterior lobe of the brain, the anterior cerebral artery, the
            anterior facial vein, etc. Scholar and lawyers may use anterior to mean
            &ldquo;earlier in time or order.&rdquo; For example, supporters of states' rights point out
            that the individual states enjoyed certain rights anterior to their joining the
            union. And prenuptial agreements are designed to protect the assets that one
            or both parties acquired anterior to the marriage.</p>

        <p>ORTHO comes from orthos, the Greek word for &ldquo;straight,&rdquo; &ldquo;right,&rdquo; or

            posture by providing artificial support for weak joints or muscles. And

        <p>orthodontics A branch of dentistry that deals with the

        <p>&bull; A specialty in orthodontics would require three more years of study after
            completing her dentistry degree.
        </p>
        <p>Orthodontics has been practiced since ancient times, but the elaborate
            techniques familiar to us today were introduced only in recent decades.
            Braces, retainers, and headgear are used to fix such conditions as crowding of
            the teeth and overbites. According to a 1939 text, &ldquo;Speech defects,
            psychiatric disturbances, personality changes, . . . all are correctable through
            orthodontic measures,&rdquo; though many adolescents, having endured the
            embarrassment of rubber bands breaking and even of entangling their braces
            while kissing, might disagree.</p>

        <p>orthodox (1) Holding established beliefs, especially in
            religion. (2) Conforming to established rules or traditions; conventional.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The O'Briens remain orthodox Catholics, faithfully observing the time-
            honored rituals of their church.
        </p>
        <p>An orthodox religious belief or interpretation is one handed down by a
            church's founders or leaders. When capitalized, as in Orthodox Judaism,
            Orthodox refers to a branch within a larger religious organization that claims
            to honor the religion's original or traditional beliefs. The steadfast holding of
            established beliefs that is seen in religious orthodoxy is apparent also in other
            kinds of orthodox behavior. Orthodox medical treatment, for example,
            follows the established practices of mainstream medicine. Unorthodox
            thinking is known in business language as &ldquo;thinking outside the box.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>orthopedics The correction or prevention of deformities

        <p>&bull; For surgery to correct the child's spinal curvature, they were referred to the
            hospital's orthopedics section.
        </p>
        <p>Just as an orthodontist corrects crookedness in the teeth, an orthopedist
            corrects crookedness in the skeleton. Orthopedics is formed in part from the
            Greek word for &ldquo;child,&rdquo; and many orthopedic patients are in fact children.
            But adults also often have need of orthopedic therapy, as when suffering from
            a joint disease like arthritis or when recovering from a broken arm or leg.</p>

        <p>orthography The spelling of words, especially spelling

        </p>
        <p>&bull; Even such eloquent writers as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson
            were deficient in the skill of orthography.
        </p>
        <p>Even as recently as the 19th century, the orthography of the English language
            was still unsettled. Not until spelling books like Noah Webster's and
            textbooks like &ldquo;McGuffey's Readers&rdquo; came along did uniform spelling
            become established in the U.S. Before that, there was much orthographic
            variation, even among the more educated. The many people who still have
            problems with spelling can take heart from Mark Twain, who once remarked,
            &ldquo;I don't give a damn for a man that can spell a word only one way.&rdquo;</p>

            with straight parallel sides. Rectus, short for Latin rectus musculus, may refer

        <p>We associate straightness with honesty, so if we suspect someone is lying we

            crooked or label him a crook. Rectitude may sound a little old-fashioned

        <p>rectilinear (1) Moving in or forming a straight line. (2)

        <p>&bull; After admiring Frank Lloyd Wright's rectilinear buildings for years, the
            public was astonished by the giant spiral of the Guggenheim Museum.
        </p>
        <p>Rectilinear patterns or constructions are those in which straight lines are
            strikingly obvious. In geometry, rectilinear usually means &ldquo;perpendicular&rdquo;;
            thus, a rectilinear polygon is a many-sided shape whose angles are all right
            angles (the footprints of most houses, with their extensions and garages, are

        <p>&bull; Eugenic techniques have been part of sheep breeding for many years.
        </p>
        <p>The word eugenic, like the name Eugene, includes the Greek root meaning
            &ldquo;born&rdquo; (see GEN). Breeders of farm animals have long used eugenic methods
            to produce horses that run faster, for example, or pigs that provide more
            meat. Through eugenics, Holstein cows have become one of the world's
            highest producers of milk. But eugenics also has a dark side. The idea of
            human eugenics was taken up enthusiastically by the Nazis in the 20th

        <p>The use of euphemisms is an ancient part of the English language, and
            perhaps of all languages, and all of us use them. Golly and gosh started out as
            euphemisms for God, and darn is a familiar euphemism for damn. Shoot,

            use the word for the kind of abnormal or inappropriate high spirits that might
            be caused by a drug or by mental illness, but euphoria is usually natural and
            appropriate. When we win enough money in the lottery to buy several small

            makes a speech in the dead person's honor&mdash;or often instead for someone

        <p>DYS comes from Greek, where it means &ldquo;bad&rdquo; or &ldquo;difficult.&rdquo; So dysphagia is

            is an inability to use and understand language because of injury to or disease

        <p>dystopia An imaginary place where people lead dehumanized

        </p>
        <p>&bull; For a 10-year-old British boy, boarding school could be a grim dystopia,
            with no comforts, harsh punishments, and constant bullying.
        </p>
        <p>Dystopia was created from Utopia, the name of an ideal country imagined by
            Sir Thomas More in 1516. For More, the suffix -topia meant &ldquo;place&rdquo; (see
            TOP), and u- (from the Greek root ou) meant &ldquo;no,&rdquo; but also perhaps &ldquo;good&rdquo;
            (see EU). In other words, More's Utopia was too good to be true. It's probably
            no accident that dystopia was first used around 1950, soon after George
            Orwell published his famous novel Nineteen Eighty-Four and 16 years after
            Aldous Huxley published Brave New World. These two are still the most
            famous of the 20th century's many depressingly dystopian novels. And what
            about all those bleak futuristic films: Blade Runner, Brazil, The Matrix, and
            the rest? What does it mean when no one will paint a picture of a happy

            recognize and process words and letters. Dyslexia usually shows itself in the
            tendency to read and write words and letters in reversed order; sometimes
            similar reversals occur in the person's speech. Dyslexia has been shown to be

        </p>
        <p>Dyspepsia comes from the Greek word for &ldquo;bad digestion.&rdquo; Interestingly, the
            Greek verb pessein can mean either &ldquo;to cook&rdquo; or &ldquo;to digest&rdquo;; bad cooking has
            been responsible for a lot of dyspepsia. Dyspepsia can be caused by many
            diseases, but dyspeptic individuals are often the victims of their own habits
            and appetites. Worry, overeating, inadequate chewing, and excessive
            smoking and drinking can all bring on dyspepsia. Today we generally use
            dyspeptic to mean &ldquo;irritable&rdquo;&mdash;that is, in the kind of mood that could be

        <p>A posteriori, Latin for &ldquo;from the latter,&rdquo; is a term from logic, which usually

            kind of reasoning can sometimes lead to false conclusions. The fact that
            sunrise follows the crowing of a rooster, for example, doesn't necessarily

        <p>&bull; Her colleagues rejected the a priori argument because it rested on
            assumptions they felt weren't necessarily true.
        </p>
        <p>A priori, Latin for &ldquo;from the former,&rdquo; is traditionally contrasted with a
            posteriori (see above). The term usually describes lines of reasoning or
            arguments that proceed from the general to the particular, or from causes to
            effects. Whereas a posteriori knowledge is knowledge based solely on
            experience or personal observation, a priori knowledge is knowledge that
            comes from the power of reasoning based on self-evident truths. So, for
            example, &ldquo;Every mother has had a child&rdquo; is an a priori statement, since it
            shows simple logical reasoning and isn't a statement of fact about a specific
            case (such as &ldquo;This woman is the mother of five children&rdquo;) that the speaker

            that the person has every intention of keeping. A bona fide proposal of
            marriage is one made by a suitor who isn't kidding around. Bona fide also has

        <p>&ldquo;Without a warranty, the buyer must take the risk&rdquo; is the basic meaning of the

            each other and were on equal footing. The nature of modern commerce and

            crime has been committed. In a case of arson, it would be a ruined building;
            in a murder case, the victim's corpse.</p>

        <p>EQU comes from the Latin word aequus, meaning &ldquo;equal.&rdquo; To equalize
            means to make things equal. Things that are equivalent have the same value,
            use, or meaning. All three sides of an equilateral triangle are of the same
            length. And an equation (for instance, 21 + 47 = 68) is a statement that two
            mathematical expressions are equal.</p>

        <p>equable (1) Tending to remain calm. (2) Free from harsh
            changes or extreme variation.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Her friends thought it odd that such an equable woman had married a man
            so moody and unpredictable.
        </p>
        <p>Equable usually describes either climate or personality. The word seems to
            be used less today than in decades past, maybe because the personality type is
            less admired than it used to be. A steady, calm, equable personality may not
            produce much excitement but usually makes for a good worker and a good
            parent, and maybe even a longer life. In the words of the poet Robert Service:
            &ldquo;Avoid extremes: be moderate / In saving and in spending. / An equable and
            easy gait / Will win an easy ending.&rdquo;</p>

        </p>
        <p>When we question the adequacy of health-care coverage, or parking facilities,
            or school funding, we're asking if they are equal to our need. The adjective
            adequate means &ldquo;enough&rdquo; or &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo;&mdash;though in sentences like &ldquo;His
            performance was adequate,&rdquo; it really means &ldquo;no better than acceptable.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>equilibrium (1) A state in which opposing forces are

        <p>&bull; The news had come as a shock, and it took him several minutes to recover
            his equilibrium.
        </p>
        <p>Equilibrium contains a root from the Latin libra, meaning &ldquo;weight&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;balance.&rdquo; As a constellation, zodiac symbol, and astrological sign, Libra is
            usually pictured as a set of balance scales, often held by the blindfolded
            goddess of justice, which symbolizes fairness, equality, and justice.
            Equilibrium has special meanings in biology, chemistry, physics, and
            economics, but in all of them it refers to the balance of competing influences.</p>

        <p>equinox A day when day and night are the same length.

        <p>&bull; She and her friends got together for an equinox party twice a year to
            celebrate the arrival of the fall and the spring.
        </p>
        <p>If you know that nox means &ldquo;night&rdquo; in Latin, it's not hard to remember the
            meaning of equinox. There are two equinoxes in the year: the spring equinox,
            around March 21, and the fall equinox, around September 23. The equinoxes
            are contrasted with the solstices, when the sun is farthest north and south of
            the equator. The summer solstice occurs around June 22 (the longest day of
            the year), the winter solstice around December 22 (the shortest day).</p>

        <p>inquisition A questioning or examining that is often

        <p>&bull; The President's first choice for the job turned him down, fearing the Senate
            hearings would turn into an inquisition into her past.
        </p>
        <p>While an inquiry can be almost any search for truth, the related word
            inquisition suggests a long, thorough investigation that involves extensive
            and harsh questioning. Though the two words originally had about the same
            meaning, today inquisition tends to remind us of the Spanish Inquisition, an
            ongoing trial conducted by church-appointed inquisitors that began in the
            Middle Ages and sought out nonbelievers, Jews, and Muslims, thousands of
            whom were sentenced to torture and to burning at the stake.</p>

        <p>perquisite (1) A privilege or profit that is provided in
            addition to one's base salary. (2) Something claimed as an exclusive
            possession or right.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; A new car, a big house, and yearly trips to Europe were among the
            perquisites that made the presidency of Wyndam College such an attractive
            position.
        </p>
        <p>Though the Latin source of perquisite originally meant &ldquo;something insistently
            asked for,&rdquo; the &ldquo;ask&rdquo; meaning has mostly vanished from the English word. A
            perquisite, often called simply a perk, is instead something of value that the
            holder of a particular job or position is entitled to, usually without even
            asking. The President of the United States, for instance, enjoys as perquisites
            the use of Camp David and Air Force One. Perhaps because perquisites are
            usually available to only a small number of people, the word sometimes
            refers to non-job-related privileges that are claimed as exclusive rights.</p>

        <p>acquisitive Eager to acquire; greedy.

        <p>&bull; With each year the couple became more madly acquisitive, buying jewelry,
            a huge yacht, and two country estates.
        </p>
        <p>Unlike most tribal peoples and the populations of some older countries, we
            Americans live in an acquisitive society, a society devoted to getting and
            spending. And America often makes successfully acquisitive people into
            heroes; even Ebenezer Scrooge, that model of miserly greed and
            acquisitiveness, was once defended by a White House chief of staff. An
            acquisitive nation may seek to acquire other territories by force. But mental
            acquisition of specialized knowledge or skills&mdash;or new vocabulary!&mdash;doesn't
            deprive others of the same information.</p>

        <p>Requisition was originally a noun but is now probably more common as a

            requisition for computers, or of requisitioning more computers from the
            department. The word has an official sound to it. However, one of

        <p>Plenary often shows up in writing referring to the &ldquo;plenary power&rdquo; held by a
            government, and is particularly used for powers mentioned in a constitution.
            For example, under the U.S. Constitution, the Congress has plenary power to
            wage war, which means that no one else&mdash;not the courts, not the states, not
            the president&mdash;has any power whatsoever to second-guess Congress about
            warmaking. But in recent years, that hasn't stopped some presidents from
            starting conflicts that looked a lot like wars to most people. At a conference,
            the plenary sessions (unlike the various smaller &ldquo;presentations,&rdquo;
            &ldquo;workshops,&rdquo; &ldquo;forums,&rdquo; and &ldquo;seminars&rdquo; that otherwise fill the day) try
            to
            bring everyone together in the same room.</p>

        <p>A complement fills out or balances something. We think of salt as the
            complement of pepper (maybe mostly because of their colors), and the right
            necktie is a perfect complement to a good suit. Complement can also mean
            &ldquo;the full quantity, number, or amount&rdquo;; thus, a ship's complement of officers
            and crew is the whole force necessary for full operation. Complement is
            actually most common as a verb; we may say, for example, that a bright blue
            scarf complements a cream-colored outfit beautifully. Don't confuse
            complement with compliment, which means an expression of respect or

        </p>
        <p>&bull; Americans have resisted using the metric system for years, but are now
            slowly getting accustomed to a few of the metric units.
        </p>
        <p>The metric system was invented in France in the years following the French
            Revolution, and a version of it is now used in most of the world to measure
            distance, weight, and volume. Basic metric units include the kilogram (the
            basic unit of weight), the liter (the basic unit of volume), and of course the
            meter (the basic unit of length&mdash;see below). Metric&mdash;or more often metrical
            &mdash;can also refer to the basic underlying rhythm of songs and poetry. So while
            the scientists' measurements are usually metric, the poets' are usually
            metrical.</p>
        <p />
    </div>

        <p />
        <p>meter (1) The basic metric unit of length, equal to about 39.37
            inches. (2) A systematic rhythm in poetry or music.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The basic meter of the piece was 3/4, but its rhythms were so complicated
            that the 3/4 was sometimes hard to hear.
        </p>
        <p>Meter is a metric measurement slightly longer than a yard; thus, a 100-meter
            dash might take you a second longer than a 100-yard dash. But the word has
            a different sense in music, where people aren't separated by whether they use
            the metric system. For a musician, the meter is the regular background
            rhythm, expressed by the &ldquo;time signature&rdquo; written at the beginning of a piece
            or section: 2/2, 2/4, 3/8, 4/4, 6/8, etc. Within a meter, you can create rhythms
            that range from the simple to the complex. So, for example, &ldquo;America the
            Beautiful&rdquo; is in 4/4 meter (or &ldquo;4/4 time&rdquo;), but so are most of the rhythmically
            complex songs written by Paul Simon, Burt Bacharach, or Stevie Wonder. In
            ordinary conversation, though, most people use &ldquo;rhythm&rdquo; to include meter
            and everything that's built on top of it. In poetry, meter has much the same
            meaning; however, poetic meters aren't named with numbers but instead with
            traditional Greek and Latin terms such as iambic and dactylic.</p>

        <p>Odometer includes the root from the Greek word hodos, meaning &ldquo;road&rdquo; or

            tachometer, and maybe a &ldquo;tripmeter.&rdquo; The odometer is what crooked car

            having traveled. One of life's little pleasures is watching the odometer as all

        <p>&bull; Even though one purpose of a tachometer is to help drivers keep their
            engine speeds down, some of us occasionally try to see how high we can
            make the needle go.
        </p>
        <p>A tachometer is literally a &ldquo;speed-measurer,&rdquo; since the Greek root tach-
            means &ldquo;speed.&rdquo; This is clear in the names of the tachyon, a particle of matter
            that travels faster than the speed of light (if it actually exists, it's so fast that
            it's impossible to see with any instrument), and tachycardia, a medical
            condition in which the heart races uncontrollably. Since the speed that an
            auto tachometer measures is speed of rotation of the crankshaft, the numbers
            it reports are revolutions per minute, or rpm's.</p>

        <p>AUD from the Latin verb audire, is the root that has to do with hearing.
            What is audible can be heard. An audience is a group of listeners, sometimes
            seated in an auditorium. And audio today can mean almost anything that has
            to do with sound.</p>

        <p>auditor A person who formally examines and verifies financial
            accounts.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; It seems impossible that so many banks could have gotten into so much
            trouble if their auditors had been doing their jobs.
        </p>
        <p>The auditing of a company's financial records by independent examiners on a
            regular basis is necessary to prevent &ldquo;cooking the books,&rdquo; and thus to keep
            the company honest. We don't normally think of auditors as listening, since
            looking at and adding up numbers is their basic line of work, but auditors do
            have to listen to people's explanations, and perhaps that's the historical link.
            Hearing is more obviously part of another meaning of audit, the kind that
            college students do when they sit in on a class without taking exams or
            receiving an official grade.</p>

        <p>auditory (1) Perceived or experienced through hearing. (2) Of

        <p>&bull; With the &ldquo;surround-sound&rdquo; systems in most theaters, going to a movie is
            now an auditory experience as much as a visual one.
        </p>
        <p>Auditory is close in meaning to acoustic and acoustical, but auditory usually
            refers more to hearing than to sound. For instance, many dogs have great
            auditory (not acoustic) powers, and the auditory nerve lets us hear by
            connecting the inner ear to the brain. Acoustic and acoustical instead refer
            especially to instruments and the conditions under which sound can be heard;
            so architects concern themselves with the acoustic properties of an
            auditorium, and instrument makers with those of a clarinet or piano.</p>

        <p>audition A trial performance to evaluate a performer's skills.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Auditions for Broadway shows attract so many hopeful unknown
            performers that everyone in the business calls them &ldquo;cattle calls.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>Most stars are discovered at auditions, where a number of candidates read the
            same part and the director chooses. Lana Turner famously skipped the
            audition process and was instead discovered by an agent sipping a soda in a
            Sunset Boulevard caf&eacute; at age 16. Audition can also be a verb; so, for example,
            after Miss Turner gained her stardom, actors had to audition to be her leading
            man. But when musicians audition for a job in an orchestra, it's usually
            behind a screen so that the judges won't even know their sex and therefore
            can't do anything but listen.</p>

        <p>With its negative prefix in-, inaudible means the opposite of audible. What's
            clearly audible to you may be inaudible to your elderly grandfather. Modern
            spy technology can turn inaudible conversations into audible ones with the
            use of high-powered directional microphones, so if you think you're being
            spied on, make sure there's a lot of other noise around you. And if you don't

            barrier&rdquo; and created the first sonic boom. In the decades afterward sonic
            booms became a familiar sound to Americans. (Because of steps that were
            eventually taken, sonic booms are rarely heard anymore.) Today sonic is
            often used by ambitious rock musicians to describe their experimental
            sounds.</p>

        <p>dissonant (1) Clashing or discordant, especially in music. (2)
            Incompatible or disagreeing.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Critics of the health-care plan pointed to its two seemingly dissonant goals:
            cost containment, which would try to control spending, and universal
            coverage, which could increase spending.
        </p>
        <p>Since dissonant includes the negative prefix dis-, what is dissonant sounds or
            feels unresolved, unharmonic, and clashing. Early in the 20th century,
            composers such as Arnold Schoenberg and his students developed the use of
            dissonance in music as a style in itself. But to many listeners, the sounds in
            such music are still unbearable, and most continue to prefer music based on
            traditional tonality. Dissonant is now often used without referring to sound at
            all. Cognitive dissonance, for example, is what happens when you believe
            two different things that can't actually both be true.</p>

        <p>resonance (1) A continuing or echoing of sound. (2) A

        </p>
        <p>&bull; The resonance of James Earl Jones's vocal tones in such roles as Darth
            Vader made his voice one of the most recognizable of its time.
        </p>
        <p>Many of the finest musical instruments possess a high degree of resonance
            which, by producing additional vibrations and echoes of the original sound,
            enriches and amplifies it. Violins made by the Italian masters Stradivari and
            Guarneri possess a quality of resonance that later violinmakers have never
            precisely duplicated. And you may have noticed how a particular note will
            start something in a room buzzing, as one of the touching surfaces begins to
            resonate with the note. Because of that, resonance and resonate&mdash;along with
            the adjective resonant&mdash;aren't always used to describe sound. For example,
            you may say that a novel resonates strongly with you because the author
            seems to be describing your own experiences and feelings.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Ultrasound, or ultrasonography, works on the principle that sound is
            reflected at different speeds by tissues or substances of different densities.
            Ultrasound technology has been used medically since the 1940s. Sonograms,
            the pictures produced by ultrasound, can reveal heart defects, tumors, and
            gallstones; since low-power ultrasonic waves don't present any risks to a
            body, they're most often used to display fetuses during pregnancy in order to
            make sure they're healthy. Ultrasonics has many other uses, including
            underwater sonar sensing. High-power ultrasonics are so intense that they're

        <p>ERR from the Latin verb errare, means &ldquo;to wander&rdquo; or &ldquo;to stray.&rdquo; The root
            is seen in the word error, meaning a wandering or straying from what is
            correct or true. Erratum (plural, errata) is Latin for &ldquo;mistake&rdquo;; so an errata
            page is a book page that lists mistakes found too late to correct before the
            book's publication.</p>

        <p>Errant means both &ldquo;wandering&rdquo; and &ldquo;mistaken.&rdquo; A knight-errant was a
            wandering knight who went about slaying dragons or rescuing damsels in
            distress (at least when he was on good behavior). Arrant is a old-fashioned
            spelling of errant; an arrant knave (the phrase comes from Shakespeare) is
            an extremely untrustworthy individual. An errant sock might be one that's
            gotten lost; an errant politician might be one who's been caught cheating; and
            an errant cloud might be one that floats by all alone in a deep-blue sky on a

            his mental stability.
        </p>
        <p>Something aberrant has wandered away from the usual path or form. The
            word is generally used in a negative way; aberrant behavior, for example,
            may be a symptom of other problems. But the discovery of an aberrant
            variety of a species can be exciting news to a biologist, and identifying an
            aberrant gene has led the way to new treatments for diseases.</p>

        <p>Erratic can refer to literal &ldquo;wandering.&rdquo; A missile that loses its guidance
            system may follow an erratic path, and a river with lots of twists and bends is
            said to have an erratic course. Erratic can also mean &ldquo;inconsistent&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;irregular.&rdquo; So a stock market that often changes direction is said to be acting
            erratically; an erratic heartbeat can be cause for concern; and if your car idles

        </p>
        <p>Erroneous basically means &ldquo;containing errors,&rdquo; and, since most of us are
            constantly suffering from mistaken notions, the word is often used in front of
            words such as &ldquo;assumption&rdquo; and &ldquo;idea.&rdquo; It's also used to describe the kind of

            of the children this year.
        </p>
        <p>Cede is often a formal term used in discussing territory and rights, but is also
            used less formally. So, for example, Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the U.S. in
            1898, following the Spanish-American War, and the U.S. ceded control of the
            Panama Canal to Panama in 1999. Critics warn that we are ceding leadership
            in alternative-energy technology to China. Citizens of one European country
            or another are always worrying that their own country is ceding too much
            power to the European Union. A tennis player doesn't have any choice when
            she cedes her no. 1 ranking to a rival.</p>

        <p>&bull; This time Congress refused to accede to the demands of the president, and
            began cutting the funding for the war.
        </p>
        <p>To accede usually means to yield, often under pressure and with some
            reluctance, to the needs or requests of others. Voters usually accede to a tax
            increase only when they're convinced it's the only real solution to a shortfall
            in government funding. A patient may accede to surgery only after the doctor
            assures him it's better than the alternatives. If you accede to your spouse's

        <p>&bull; When Judy bought Christmas presents for all her relatives one year, she
            claimed that it set no precedent, but it did.
        </p>
        <p>A precedent is something that precedes, or comes before. The Supreme Court
            relies on precedents&mdash;that is, earlier laws or decisions that provide some
            example or rule to guide them in the case they're actually deciding. When
            hostages are being held for ransom, a government may worry about setting a
            bad precedent if it gives in. And a company might &ldquo;break with precedent&rdquo; by
            naming a foreigner as its president for the first time.</p>

        <p>Augean stable A condition or place marked by great
            accumulation of filth or corruption.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Leaders of many of the newly formed nations of Eastern Europe found that
            the old governments of their countries had become Augean stables that they
            must now clean out.
        </p>
        <p>Augeus, the mythical king of Elis, kept great stables that held 3,000 oxen and
            had not been cleaned for thirty years when Hercules was assigned the job as
            one of his famous &ldquo;twelve labors.&rdquo; This task was enormous even for someone
            so mighty, so Hercules shifted the course of two rivers to make them pour
            through the stables. Augean by itself has come to mean &ldquo;extremely difficult
            or distasteful&rdquo;, and to &ldquo;clean the Augean stable&rdquo; usually means either to clear
            away corruption or to perform a large and unpleasant task that has long called
            for attention. So today we refer to &ldquo;Augean tasks,&rdquo; &ldquo;Augean labor,&rdquo; or even
            &ldquo;Augean clutter.&rdquo; And the British firm Augean PLC is&mdash;what else?&mdash;a

        <p>Croesus, which tends to appear in the phrase &ldquo;rich as Croesus,&rdquo; was the name
            of a king of Lydia, an ancient kingdom in what is now western Turkey, who
            died around 546 B.C. Lydia was probably the first country in history to use
            coins, and under the wealthy and powerful Croesus the first coins of pure
            silver and gold were produced, which may have added to the legends
            surrounding his wealth. But it was Croesus who the Greek lawgiver Solon
            was thinking about when he said &ldquo;Count no man happy until his death&rdquo;&mdash;and
            indeed Croesus was finally overthrown and may even have been burned

        <p>&bull; Many experts believed that, in invading a Middle Eastern country that
            hadn't attacked us, we were sowing dragon's teeth.
        </p>
        <p>The Phoenician prince Cadmus once killed a dragon, and was instructed by
            the goddess Athena to plant its teeth in the ground. From the many teeth,
            there immediately sprang up an army of fierce armed men. The goddess then
            directed him to throw a precious stone into their midst, and they proceeded to
            slaughter each other until only the five greatest warriors were left; these
            became Cadmus's generals, with whom he constructed the great city-state of
            Thebes. When we &ldquo;sow dragon's teeth,&rdquo; we're creating the conditions for
            future trouble.</p>

        <p>Hades The underground home of the dead in Greek mythology.

        <p>&bull; In a dramatic scene, he crawls up out of the ground coated in black
            petroleum as though emerging from Hades.
        </p>
        <p>In Greek mythology, Hades is both the land of the dead and the god who
            rules there. Hades the god (who the Greeks also called Pluto) is the brother of
            Zeus and Poseidon, who rule the skies and the seas. The realm called Hades,
            where he rules with his wife Persephone, is the region under the earth, full of
            mineral wealth and fertility and home to dead souls. Hades today is
            sometimes used as a polite term for Hell (&ldquo;It's hotter than Hades in here!&rdquo;).</p>

        <p>lethargic (1) Lazily sluggish. (2) Indifferent or apathetic.

        <p>&bull; Once again the long Sunday dinner had left most of the family feeling
            stuffed and lethargic.
        </p>
        <p>The philosopher Plato wrote that before a dead person could leave the
            underworld to begin a new life, he or she had to drink from the river Lethe,
            whose name means &ldquo;forgetfulness&rdquo; in Greek, and forget all aspects of one's
            former life and the time spent in Hades (usually pretty awful, according to
            Plato). But lethargic and its noun lethargy never actually refer to forgetting;
            instead, they describe the weak, ghostly state of the dead spirits&mdash;so weak
            that they may require a drink of blood before they can even speak.</p>

            touch, but after a couple of good years each adviser's brilliance usually seems
            to vanish.
        </p>
        <p>Midas was a legendary king of Phrygia (in modern-day Turkey). In return for
            a good deed, he was granted one wish by the god Dionysus, and asked for the
            power to turn everything he touched into gold. When he discovered to his
            horror that his touch had turned his food and drink&mdash;and even his daughter&mdash;
            to gold, he begged Dionysus to take back the gift, and Dionysus agreed to do
            so. When &ldquo;Midas touch&rdquo; is used today, the moral of this tale of greed is
            usually ignored.</p>

        <p>The Greek underworld of Hades was cold and dark, rather than blazing like
            the Christian image of Hell. The river Styx, whose name meant &ldquo;hateful&rdquo; in
            Greek, was the chief river of the underground, and the souls of the dead were
            ferried across its poisonous waters into Hades by the boatman Charon. The
            Styx was so terrible that even the gods swore by its name in their most
            solemn oaths. The name Stygia, borrowed from stygian, is used for a country
            in fantasy games today; but a stygian atmosphere, a stygian tunnel, stygian

        <p>VIS comes from a Latin verb meaning &ldquo;see.&rdquo; Vision is what enables us to
            see, visual images are visible to our eyes, and a visitor is someone who comes
            to see something. The same verb actually gives us another root, vid-, as in
            Julius Caesar's famous statement about his military exploits, &ldquo;Veni, vidi,
            vici&rdquo; (&ldquo;I came, I saw, I conquered&rdquo;), and such common English words as

        <p>vista (1) A distant view. (2) An extensive mental view, as over a

        <p>&bull; The economic vista for the next two years looks excellent, according to a
            poll of business economists.
        </p>
        <p>Vista is generally used today for broad sweeping views of the kind you might
            see from a mountaintop. But the word originally meant an avenue-like view,
            narrowed by a line of trees on either side. And vista has also long been used
            (like view and outlook) to mean a mental scan of the future&mdash;as if you were
            riding down a long grand avenue and what you could see a mile or so ahead
            of you was where you'd be in the very near future.</p>

        <p>&bull; Many financial reporters worry about the loss of U.S. economic strength
            vis-&agrave;-vis our principal trading partners.
        </p>
        <p>Vis-&agrave;-vis comes from Latin by way of French, where it means literally &ldquo;face-
            to-face.&rdquo; In English it was first used to mean a little horse-drawn carriage in
            which two people sat opposite each other. From there it acquired various
            other meanings, such as &ldquo;dancing partner.&rdquo; Today it no longer refers to actual
            physical faces and bodies, but its modern meaning comes from the fact that
            things that are face-to-face can easily be compared or contrasted. So, for
            example, a greyhound is very tall vis-&agrave;-vis a Scottie, and the Red Sox have
            often fared badly vis-&agrave;-vis the Yankees.</p>

        <p>&bull; His followers regarded him as an inspired visionary; his opponents saw him
            as either a con man or a lunatic.
        </p>
        <p>A visionary is someone with a strong vision of the future. Since such visions
            aren't always accurate, a visionary's ideas may either work brilliantly or fail
            miserably. Even so, visionary is usually a positive word. Martin Luther King,
            Jr., for instance, was a visionary in his hopes and ideas for a just society. The
            word is also an adjective; thus, for example, we may speak of a visionary
            project, a visionary leader, a visionary painter, or a visionary company.</p>

            arguing, and none of us could envisage the relationship lasting for long.
        </p>
        <p>One of the imagination's most valuable uses is its ability to see something in
            the &ldquo;mind's eye&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to visualize, envision, or envisage something.
            Envisaging a possibility may be one of the chief abilities that separate human
            beings from the other animals. What we envisage may be physical (such as a
            completed piece of furniture) or nonphysical (such as finishing college).
            Envisaging life with a puppy might lead us down to the pound to buy one,

            produces several familiar English words. Spectacles can be glasses that you
            look through; but a spectacle can also be a remarkable sight&mdash;in Roman
            times, perhaps a spectacular chariot race or a spectacularly bloody battle

        </p>
        <p>Since aspectus in Latin means &ldquo;looked at,&rdquo; an aspect of something is
            basically the direction from which it's looked at. So we may say that travel is
            your favorite aspect of your job, or that eating well is one aspect of a healthy
            life. If you look at a stage set from the front, it looks completely different
            than from behind, where all the mechanisms are visible, and both aspects are
            important. The word can be very useful when you're analyzing something,
            and it's used a great deal in the writings of scholars.</p>

        <p>Since the Latin prefix pro- often means &ldquo;forward&rdquo; (see PRO), prospect refers
            to looking forward. The prospect of a recession may lead investors to pull
            their money out of the stock market. Graduates of a good law school usually
            have excellent prospects for finding employment. Prospective students roam

            of painting or drawing a scene so that objects in it seem to have depth and
            distance.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; From the perspective of the lowly soldier, the war looked very different.
        </p>
        <p>To the modern mind, it's hard to believe that perspective had to be
            &ldquo;discovered,&rdquo; but before the 1400s paintings simply lacked accurate
            perspective. Instead, important people and objects were simply shown larger
            than less important ones; and although distant objects were sometimes shown
            smaller than near ones, this wasn't done in a regular and accurate way. Just as
            odd, many paintings didn't represent the other meaning of perspective either
            &mdash;that is, a scene might not be shown as if it were being seen from one single
            place. Today, perspective is used much like standpoint. Just as standpoint
            once used to mean simply the physical place where you stand but today also
            means the way you &ldquo;see&rdquo; things as a result of who you are and what you do,
            the same could be said about perspective.</p>

        <p>&bull; The prospectus for the mutual fund says nothing about how its profit
            forecasts were calculated.
        </p>
        <p>Like prospect, prospectus looks forward. Thus, a prospectus originally
            outlined something that didn't yet exist, describing what it would become.
            This might even be a book; the great dictionary of Noah Webster, like that of
            Samuel Johnson, was first announced in the form of a prospectus, so that
            well-to-do people might actually subscribe to it&mdash;that is, pay for it in advance
            so that Webster would have money to live on while writing it. Soon,
            prospectus was being used to mean a description of a private school or
            college, intended to attract new students. Today the word very often means a
            description of a stock offering or mutual fund, whether new or not.</p>

        <p>VOC comes from the Latin words meaning &ldquo;voice&rdquo; and &ldquo;speak.&rdquo; So a vocal
            ensemble is a singing group. A vocation was originally a &ldquo;calling&rdquo; from God
            to do religious work as a priest, monk, or nun, though today most people use
            the word just to mean a career. And a vocabulary is a set of words for

        <p>With its root equi-, meaning &ldquo;equal,&rdquo; equivocate suggests speaking on both
            sides of an issue at the same time. An equivocal answer is one that manages
            not to take a stand; an unequivocal answer, by contrast, is strong and clear.
            Politicians are famous for equivocating, but equivocation is also typical of
            used-car salesmen, nervous witnesses in a courtroom, and guys whose

        </p>
        <p>Irrevocable has a formal sound to it and is often used in legal contexts.
            Irrevocable trusts are trust funds that cannot be dissolved by the people who
            created them (the other kind is a revocable trust). An irrevocable credit is an
            absolute obligation from a bank to provide credit to a customer. Irrevocable
            gifts, under U.S. tax law, are gifts that are given by one living person to

        <p>phonics A method of teaching beginners to read and pronounce
            words by learning the characteristic sounds of letters, letter groups, and
            especially syllables.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; My son's school switched to phonics instruction several years ago, and
            reading achievement in the early grades has been improving.
        </p>
        <p>In the field of beginning reading, there are two basic schools of thought in the
            U.S. today. One emphasizes &ldquo;whole language&rdquo; teaching, which relies on
            teaching a lot of reading; the other emphasizes phonics, teaching how letters
            and syllables correspond to sounds. Phonics instruction may be especially
            difficult in English, since English has the most difficult spelling of any
            Western language. Consider the various ways we create the f sound in cough,
            photo, and giraffe, or the sh sound in special, issue, vicious, and portion, or
            the k sound in tack, quite, and shellac, and how we pronounce the o in do,
            core, lock, and bone, or the ea in lead, ocean, idea, and early. Teaching
            phonics obviously isn't an easy job, but it's probably an important one.</p>

        <p>phonetic Relating to or representing the sounds of the spoken

        </p>
        <p>&bull; In almost every Spanish word the pronunciation is clear from the spelling,
            so the phonetic part of learning Spanish isn't usually a big challenge.
        </p>
        <p>The English alphabet is phonetic&mdash;that is, the letters represent sounds. The
            Chinese alphabet, however, isn't phonetic, since its symbols represent ideas
            rather than sounds. But even in English, a letter doesn't always represent the
            same sound; the &ldquo;a&rdquo; in cat, father, and mate, for example, represents three
            different sounds. Because of this, books about words often use specially
            created phonetic alphabets in which each symbol stands for a single sound in
            order to represent pronunciations. So in this book, cat, father, and mate
            would be phonetically represented as , , and .</p>

        <p>polyphonic Referring to a style of music in which two or
            more melodies are sung or played against each other in harmony.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Whenever he needed something calming, he would put on some quiet
            polyphonic music from the Renaissance and just let the voices waft over him.
        </p>
        <p>Since poly- means &ldquo;many&rdquo; (see POLY), polyphonic music has &ldquo;many
            voices.&rdquo; In polyphony, each part has its own melody, and they weave together
            in a web that may become very dense; a famous piece by Thomas Tallis,
            composed around 1570, has 40 separate voice parts. Polyphony reached its
            height during the 16th century with Italian madrigals and the sacred music of
            such composers as Tallis, Palestrina, and Byrd. Usually when we speak of
            polyphony we're talking about music of Bach's time and earlier; but the
            principles remain the same today, and songwriters such as the Beatles have
            sometimes used polyphony as well.</p>

        <p>cacophony Harsh or unpleasant sound.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In New York she was often dragged off by her boyfriend to downtown jazz
            concerts, where she struggled to make sense of what sounded like nothing but
            cacophony.
        </p>
        <p>Cacophony employs the Greek prefix caco-, meaning &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; but not
            everything we call cacophonous is necessarily bad. Grunge, thrash, hardcore,
            and goth music are unlistenable to some people and very popular to others.
            Open-air food markets may be marked by a cacophony of voices but also by
            wonderful sights and sounds. On the other hand, few people can really enjoy,
            for more than a few minutes, the cacophony of jackhammers, car horns, and
            truck engines that assaults the city pedestrian on a hot day in August.</p>

        <p>Medical researchers are finding curative substances in places that surprise
            them. Folklore has led to some &ldquo;new&rdquo; cures of old diseases, and natural
            substances never before tried have often proved effective. Quinine, which
            comes from a tree in the Andes, was the original drug for malaria; aspirin's
            main ingredient came from willow bark; and Taxol, a drug used in treating
            several cancers, was originally extracted from the bark of a yew tree. The
            curative properties of these natural drugs are today duplicated in the

            caring for and repairing objects already owned, discovering frauds and
            counterfeits, lending artworks to other museums, and mounting exhibitions of

            gums will slowly deteriorate. Dentists called periodontists specialize in the
            treatment of periodontal problems, and when the gums have broken down to
            the point where they can't hold the teeth in place a periodontist may need to
            provide dental implants, a costly and unpleasant process. But even a

        <p>The philosopher Aristotle had his school at the Lyceum gymnasium in

            peripatoi. Aristotle was also said to have paced slowly while teaching, and
            the Greek word for &ldquo;pacing&rdquo; was peripatos. And finally, peripatos meant
            simply &ldquo;discussion.&rdquo; Whatever the source of the word, Aristotle and his
            followers became known as the Peripatetics, and the &ldquo;pacing&rdquo; sense led to
            peripatetic's English meaning of traveling or moving about. Johnny
            Appleseed is a good example of a peripatetic soul, and peripatetic executives

            you're driving into Chicago at rush hour, especially when switching lanes.
            When people call an issue in a discussion peripheral, they mean that it's not
            of primary importance, and they're probably suggesting that everyone get
            back to the main topic. Peripheral is now also a noun: computer peripherals
            are the added components&mdash;printers, webcams, microphones, etc.&mdash;that

            bounce off moving objects. Still other sensors may detect pressure
            (barometers) or chemicals (Breathalyzers and smoke detectors). Stud finders,
            used by carpenters to locate wooden studs under a wall, may employ magnets
            or radar. Wired gloves, which relay information about the position of the

        <p>Since extra means &ldquo;outside, beyond&rdquo; (see EXTRA), extrasensory means

            includes communication between minds involving no obvious contact
            (telepathy), gaining information about something without using the normal
            senses (clairvoyance), or predicting the future (precognition). According to
            polls, about 40% of Americans believe in ESP, and many of them have had
            personal experiences that seem to prove its existence. When someone jumps
            into your mind months or years after you had last thought of him or her, and
            the next day you learn that the person has just died, it can be hard to convince
            yourself it was just coincidence. Still, scientific attempts to prove the

            means; great music, for example, can be a source of sensuous delight.
            Sensual, on the other hand, usually describes gratification of the senses or
            physical appetites as an end in itself; thus we often think (perhaps unfairly) of
            wealthy Romans leading lives devoted to sensual pleasure. You can see why
            the Puritan Milton might have wanted another word.</p>

        <p>SOPH come from the Greek words meaning &ldquo;wise&rdquo; and &ldquo;wisdom.&rdquo; In
            English the root sometimes appears in words where the wisdom is of the
            &ldquo;wise guy&rdquo; variety, but in words such as philosophy we see it used more

        <p>sophistry Cleverly deceptive reasoning or argument.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; For lawyers and politicians, the practice of sophistry from time to time is
            almost unavoidable.
        </p>
        <p>The Sophists were a group of Greek teachers of rhetoric and philosophy,
            famous during the 5th century B.C., who moved from town to town offering
            their teaching for a fee. The Sophists originally represented a respectable
            school of philosophy, but some critics claimed that they tried to persuade by
            means of clever but misleading arguments. The philosopher Plato wrote
            negatively about them, and the comic dramatist Aristophanes made fun of
            them, showing them making ridiculously fine distinctions about word
            meanings. We get our modern meanings of sophist, sophistry, and the
            adjective sophistical mostly from the opinions of these two men.</p>

        <p>sophisticated (1) Having a thorough knowledge of the
            ways of society. (2) Highly complex or developed.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In Woman of the Year, Katharine Hepburn plays a sophisticated journalist
            who can handle everything except Spencer Tracy.
        </p>
        <p>A sophisticated argument is thorough and well-worked-out. A satellite is a
            sophisticated piece of technology, complex and designed to accomplish
            difficult tasks. A sophisticated person, such as Humphrey Bogart in
            Casablanca, knows how to get around in the world. But sophistication isn't
            always admired. As you might guess, the word is closely related to sophistry
            (see above), and its original meanings weren't very positive, and still today
            many of us aren't sure we really like sophisticates.</p>

        <p>sophomoric Overly impressed with one's own knowledge,
            but in fact undereducated and immature.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; We can't even listen to those sophomoric songs of his, with their attempts at
            profound wisdom that just demonstrate how little he knows about life.
        </p>
        <p>Sophomoric seems to include the roots soph-, &ldquo;wise,&rdquo; and moros, &ldquo;fool&rdquo;
            (seen in words such as moron), so the contrast between wisdom and
            ignorance is built right into the word. Cambridge University introduced the
            term sophomore for its second-year students in the 17th century (though it's
            no longer used in Britain), maybe to suggest that a sophomore has delusions
            of wisdom since he's no longer an ignorant freshman. In America today,
            sophomore is ambiguous since it can refer to either high school or college.
            But sophomoric should properly describe something&mdash;wit, behavior,
            arguments, etc.&mdash;that is at least trying to be sophisticated.</p>

        <p>theosophy A set of teachings about God and the world based
            on mystical insight, especially teachings founded on a blend of Buddhist and
            Hindu beliefs.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; He had experimented with a number of faiths, starting with Buddhism and
            ending with a mixture of Eastern and Western thought that could best be
            called theosophy.
        </p>
        <p>The word theosophy, combining roots meaning &ldquo;God&rdquo; and &ldquo;wisdom,&rdquo;
            appeared back in the 17th century, but the well-known religious movement
            by that name, under the leadership of the Russian Helena Blavatsky, appeared
            only around 1875. Blavatsky's theosophy combined elements of Plato's
            philosophy with Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu thought (including
            reincarnation), in a way that she claimed had been divinely revealed to her.
            The Theosophical Society, founded in 1875 to promote her beliefs, still
            exists, as does the Anthroposophical Society, founded by her follower Rudolf
            Steiner.</p>

        <p>Achilles' heel A vulnerable point.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; By now his rival for the Senate seat had discovered his Achilles' heel, the
            court records of the terrible divorce he had gone through ten years earlier.
        </p>
        <p>When the hero Achilles was an infant, his sea-nymph mother dipped him into
            the river Styx to make him immortal. But since she held him by one heel, this
            spot did not touch the water and so remained mortal and vulnerable, and it
            was here that Achilles was eventually mortally wounded. Today, the tendon
            that stretches up the calf from the heel is called the Achilles tendon. But the
            term Achilles' heel isn't used in medicine; instead, it's only used with the
            general meaning &ldquo;weak point&rdquo;&mdash;for instance, to refer to a section of a
            country's borders that aren't militarily protected, or to a Jeopardy contestant's
            ignorance in the Sports category.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Arcadia, a beautiful rural area in Greece, became the favorite setting for
            poems about ideal innocence unaffected by the passions of the larger world,
            beginning with the works of the Roman poet Virgil. There, shepherds play
            their pipes and sigh with longing for flirtatious nymphs; shepherdesses sing
            to their flocks; and goat-footed nature gods play in the fields and woods.
            Today, city dwellers who hope to retire to a country house often indulge in
            arcadian fantasies about what rural life will be like.</p>

            his predictions tended to come true.
        </p>
        <p>Cassandra, the daughter of King Priam of Troy, was one of those beautiful
            young maidens with whom Apollo fell in love. He gave her the gift of
            prophecy in return for the promise of her sexual favors, but at the last minute
            she refused him. Though he could not take back his gift, he angrily
            pronounced that no one would ever believe her predictions; so when she
            prophesied the fall of her city to the Greeks and the death of its heroes, she
            was laughed at by the Trojans. A modern-day Cassandra goes around

            encounter with a Cyclops, and escaped utter disaster only by stabbing a
            burning stick into the monster's eye. The great stone walls at such ancient
            sites as Troy and Mycenae are called cyclopean because the stones are so
            massive and the construction (which uses no cement) is so expert that it was
            assumed that only a superhuman race such as the Cyclopes could have
            achieved such a feat.</p>

        <p>draconian Extremely severe or cruel.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The severe punishments carried out in Saudi Arabia, including flogging for
            drunkenness, hand amputation for robbery, and beheading for drug
            trafficking, strike most of the world as draconian.
        </p>
        <p>Draconian comes from the name of Draco, a leader of Athens in the 7th
            century B.C. who in 621 B.C. produced its first legal code. The punishments
            he prescribed were extraordinarily harsh; almost anyone who couldn't pay his
            debts became a slave, and even minor crimes were punishable by death. So
            severe were these penalties that it was said that the code was written in blood.
            In the next century, the wise leader Solon would revise all of Draco's code,
            retaining the death penalty only for the crime of murder.</p>

        <p>&bull; To an American, these soldiers were like myrmidons, all too eager to do the
            Beloved Leader's bidding.
        </p>
        <p>In the Trojan War, the troops of the great hero Achilles were called
            Myrmidons. As bloodthirsty as wolves, they were the fiercest fighters in all
            Greece. They were said to have come from the island of Aegina, where, after
            the island's entire population had been killed by a plague, it was said to have
            been repopulated by Zeus, by turning all the ants in a great anthill into men.
            Because of their insect origin, the Myrmidons were blindly loyal to Achilles,
            so loyal that they would die without resisting if ordered to. The Trojans
            would not be the last fighting force to believe that a terrifying opposing army
            was made up of men who were not quite human.</p>

        <p>nemesis A powerful, frightening opponent or rival who is

        <p>&bull; During the 1970s and '80s, Japanese carmakers became the nemesis of the
            U.S. auto industry.
        </p>
        <p>The Greek goddess Nemesis doled out rewards for noble acts and vengeance
            for evil ones, but it's only her vengeance that anyone remembers. According
            to the Greeks, Nemesis did not always punish an offender right away, but
            might wait as much as five generations to avenge a crime. Regardless, her
            cause was always just and her eventual victory was sure. But today a nemesis
            doesn't always dispense justice; a powerful drug lord may be the nemesis of a
            Mexican police chief, for instance, just as Ernst Stavro Blofeld was James
            Bond's nemesis in three of Ian Fleming's novels.</p>

        <p>Trojan horse Someone or something that works from within

        <p>&bull; Researchers are working on a kind of Trojan horse that will be welcomed
            into the diseased cells and then destroy them from within.
        </p>
        <p>After besieging the walls of Troy for ten years, the Greeks built a huge,
            hollow wooden horse, secretly filled it with armed warriors, and presented it
            to the Trojans as a gift for the goddess Athena, and the Trojans took the horse
            inside the city's walls. That night, the armed Greeks swarmed out and
            captured and burned the city. A Trojan horse is thus anything that looks
            innocent but, once accepted, has power to harm or destroy&mdash;for example, a
            computer program that seems helpful but ends up corrupting or demolishing
            the computer's software.</p>

        <p>PORT comes from the Latin verb portare, meaning &ldquo;to carry.&rdquo; Thus,
            something portable can be carried around. A porter carries your luggage,
            whether through a train station or high into the Himalayas. When we
            transport something, we have it carried from one place to another. And goods
            for export are carried away to another country.</p>

        <p>portage The carrying of boats or goods overland from one body of
            water to another; also, a regular route for such carrying.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The only portage on the whole canoe route would be the one around the
            great waterfall on our second day.
        </p>
        <p>Portage was borrowed from French back in the 15th century to mean
            &ldquo;carrying, transporting&rdquo; or &ldquo;freight,&rdquo; and it has kept its simple
            &ldquo;carrying&rdquo;
            sense to the present day. But its first known use in its &ldquo;carrying of boats&rdquo;
            sense came in 1698, and the obstacle that the canoes couldn't be steered over
            was none other than Niagara Falls. Though canoes are much lighter today
            than they used to be, a long portage that includes a lot of camping gear can
            still test a camper's strength.</p>

        <p>portfolio (1) A flat case for carrying documents or artworks.
            (2) The investments owned by a person or organization.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In those days, a graphic artist who had recently moved to New York would
            just schlep his portfolio around to every magazine office in the city.
        </p>
        <p>Portfolio is partly based on the Latin folium, meaning &ldquo;leaf, sheet.&rdquo; A
            portfolio usually represents a portable showcase of your talents. Today actual
            portfolios are used less than they used to be by artists, since most commercial
            artists have a Web site dedicated to showing off their art. But portfolio in its
            other common meaning is extremely common. Not so long ago, a broker
            would keep each of his or her clients' investments in a separate notebook or
            portfolio. Today the investment portfolio, like an artist's portfolio, usually
            takes the form of a Web page, even though everyone still uses the same old
            word.</p>

        <p>comport (1) To be in agreement with. (2) To behave.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; This new evidence comports with everything we know about what
            happened that night.
        </p>
        <p>With its prefix com-, &ldquo;with,&rdquo; the Latin word comportare meant &ldquo;to bring
            together.&rdquo; So it's easy to see how in English we could say that a college's
            policy comports with state law, or that a visit to your parents doesn't comport
            with your other weekend plans, or that your aunt and uncle won't listen to
            anything on TV that doesn't comport with their prejudices. The &ldquo;behave&rdquo;
            sense of the word comes through French, and its essential meaning is how a
            person &ldquo;carries&rdquo; him- or herself. So you may say, for instance, that your 17-
            year-old comported himself well (for once!) at the wedding reception, or that
            an ambassador always comports herself with dignity&mdash;that is, her
            comportment is always dignified&mdash;or that your class comported itself in a
            way that was a credit to the school.</p>

        <p>deportment Manner of conducting oneself socially.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; At social events she would constantly sneak glances at Alexandra, in quiet
            admiration of her elegant and graceful deportment.
        </p>
        <p>We've all seen pictures of girls walking around balancing books on their
            heads in an effort to achieve the poise of a princess or a film star. Classes in
            deportment were once a standard part of a young lady's upbringing, offered in
            all the girls' colleges; and you can still take private deportment classes, where
            you'll learn about posture and body language, how to move, sit, stand, shake
            hands, dress, drink and eat, and much more. But deportment isn't all about
            refined female grace. In fact, deport is often used as a synonym for comport,
            but usually in a positive way; thus, people are often said to deport themselves
            well, confidently, with dignity, like gentlemen or ladies, and so on.</p>

        <p>PEND comes from the Latin verb pendere, meaning &ldquo;to hang&rdquo; or &ldquo;to weigh.&rdquo;
            (In the Roman era, weighing something large often required hanging it from a
            hook on one side of the balance scales.) We find the root in English words
            like appendix, referring to that useless and sometimes troublesome tube that
            hangs from the intestine, or that section at the back of some books that might
            contain some useful additional information.</p>

        <p>pendant Something that hangs down, especially as an

        </p>
        <p>&bull; Around her neck she was wearing the antique French pendant he had given
            her, with its three rubies set in silver filigree.
        </p>
        <p>Most pendants are purely decorative. But a pendant may also hold a picture
            or a lock of hair of a lover or a child. And, perhaps because they hang
            protectively in front of the body and near the heart, pendants have often had
            symbolic and magical purposes. Thus, a pendant may be a charm or amulet,
            or its gems or metals may be felt to have health-giving properties. In
            architecture, a pendant is an ornament that hangs down from a structure, but
            unlike a necklace pendant it's usually solid and inflexible.</p>

        <p>append To add as something extra.

        <p>&bull; She appended to the memo a list of the specific items that the school was
            most in need of.
        </p>
        <p>Append is a somewhat formal word. Lawyers, for example, often speak of
            appending items to other documents, and lawmakers frequently append small
            bills to big ones, hoping that everyone will be paying attention only to the
            main part of the big bill and won't notice. When we append a small separate
            section to the end of a report or a book, we call it an appendix. But in the
            early years of e-mail, the words we decided on were attach and attachment,
            probably because appendixes are thought of as unimportant, whereas the
            attachment is often the whole reason for sending an e-mail.</p>

        <p>appendage (1) Something joined on to a larger or more

        <p>&bull; She often complained that she felt like a mere appendage of her husband
            when they socialized with his business partners.
        </p>
        <p>Appendix isn't the only noun that comes from append. Unlike appendix,
            appendage doesn't suggest the end of something, but simply something
            attached. The word is often used in biology to refer to parts of an animal's
            body: an insect's antennae, mouthparts, or wings, for example. The
            appendages of some animals will grow back after they've been removed; a
            salamander, for example, can regrow a finger, and the tiny sea squirt can
            regrow all its appendages&mdash;and even its brain.</p>

        <p>suspend (1) To stop something, or to force someone to give up
            some right or position, for a limited time. (2) To hang something so that it is
            free on all sides.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The country has been suspended from the major trade organizations, and the
            effects on its economy are beginning to be felt.
        </p>
        <p>When something is suspended, it is &ldquo;left hanging&rdquo;; it is neither in full
            operation nor permanently ended. Suspense is a state of uncertainty and
            maybe anxiety. When we watch a play or movie, we enjoy experiencing a
            &ldquo;suspension of disbelief&rdquo;; that is, we allow ourselves to believe we're
            watching reality, even though we aren't truly fooled.Suspension can also
            mean physical hanging; thus, in a suspension bridge, the roadway actually
            hangs from huge cables. When some substance is &ldquo;in suspension,&rdquo; its
            particles are &ldquo;hanging&rdquo; in another substance, mixed into it but not actually
            dissolved, like fine sand in water, or sea spray in the air at the seashore.</p>

        <p>Panacea comes from a Greek word meaning &ldquo;all-healing,&rdquo; and Panacea was
            the goddess of healing. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, alchemists
            who sought to concoct the &ldquo;elixir of life&rdquo; (which would give eternal life) and
            the &ldquo;philosopher's stone&rdquo; (which would turn ordinary metals into gold) also
            labored to find the panacea. But no such medicine was ever found, just as no
            solution to all of a society's difficulties has ever been found. Thus, panacea is
            almost always used to criticize the very idea of a total solution (&ldquo;There's no

            Satan gathered together all his demons, by linking pan with the Latin word
            daemonium, &ldquo;evil spirit.&rdquo; For later writers, pandemonium became a synonym
            for hell itself, since hell was then often seen as a place of constant noise and
            confusion, but also for any wicked and lawless place. Nowadays it's used to

        <p>pantheism A system of belief that regards God as

            any real belief that God had ever appeared in human form.

        <p>Pantheistic ideas&mdash;and most importantly the belief that God is equal to the

            ancient books of Hinduism, in the works of many Greek philosophers, and in
            later works of philosophy and religion over the centuries. Much modern New
            Age spirituality is pantheistic. But most Christian thinkers reject pantheism
            because it makes God too impersonal, doesn't allow for any difference
            between the creation and the creator, and doesn't seem to allow for humans to

            word for the full suit of armor, and the English panoply originally likewise

            often won't send their own citizens to another country for trial; countries that
            don't permit the death penalty may not agree to send a suspect back to face
            such a penalty; and most countries won't extradite someone accused of
            political crimes. When extradition seems unlikely, a country may actually
            kidnap someone from another country, but this is illegal and rare.</p>

        <p>Extrovert (sometimes spelled extravert) means basically &ldquo;turned outward&rdquo;&mdash;
            that is, toward things outside oneself. The word was coined by the eminent
            psychologist C. G. Jung in the early 20th century. The opposite personality
            type, in Jung's view, was the introvert. Extroverts seem to be favored by
            societies such as ours, even though introverts seem to be on average more
            mentally gifted. Psychologists have said that the only personality traits that
            can be identified in newborn infants are shyness and lack of shyness, which
            are fairly close to&mdash;but not really the same as&mdash;introversion and

            strange, extraneous is a slightly formal word, often used by scientists and
            social scientists. Researchers always try to eliminate extraneous factors (or
            &ldquo;extraneous variables&rdquo;) from their studies. A researcher conducting a
            psychological test, for example, would try to make sure that the people were

            gender, age, health, and so on.</p>

        <p>&bull; They wanted to avoid the kind of smoke detector that uses radioactive
            materials, so they've installed the photoelectric kind instead.
        </p>
        <p>The photoelectric effect occurs when light (or similar radiation such as X-
            rays) falls on a material such as a metal plate and causes it to emit electrons.
            The discovery of the photoelectric effect led to important new theories about
            matter (and to a Nobel Prize for Albert Einstein). Photoelectric cells, or
            photocells, are used in burglar-alarm light detectors and garage-door openers
            (both employ a beam of light that is broken when something moves across it),
            and also to play soundtracks on movie film (where a light beam shines

            much energy as solar cells while using far less semiconducting material.
        </p>
        <p>The -voltaic part of photovoltaic comes from the name of Alessandro Volta,
            inventor of the electric battery. Thus, unlike photoelectric cells, which use
            electricity for certain small tasks, photovoltaic (or PV) cells actually produce
            electricity. Solar cells, the standard type of photovoltaic cells (often called
            simply photocells), operate without chemicals and with no moving parts to
            create energy directly from sunlight. Much research is now being done on

        <p>photon A tiny particle or bundle of radiant energy.

        <p>&bull; The idea that light consists of photons is difficult until you begin to think of
            a ray of light as being caused by a stream of tiny particles.
        </p>
        <p>It was Albert Einstein who first theorized that the energy in a light beam
            exists in small bits or particles, and scientists today know that light
            sometimes behaves like a wave (somewhat like sound or water) and
            sometimes like a stream of particles. The energies of photons range from
            high-energy gamma rays and X-rays down to low-energy infrared and radio
            waves, though all travel at the same speed. The amazing power of lasers is
            the result of a concentration of photons that have been made to travel together
            in order to hit their target at the same time.</p>

            Christians to Satan. This tradition, which dates back to the period before

            be the great light in the sky, and for his pride had been cast out of heaven and

            and mental activity, and a good diet. Writing lucidly, on the other hand, can

            examination is one conducted on a recently dead body. The Latin phrase

            common use of mortify today is the &ldquo;humiliate&rdquo; sense; its connection with
            death is still apparent when we speak of &ldquo;dying of embarrassment.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>TROPH comes from the Greek trophe, meaning &ldquo;nourishment.&rdquo; This
            particular troph- root doesn't show up in many everyday English words (the
            troph- in words like trophy, apostrophe, and catastrophe has a different

        <p>atrophy (1) Gradual loss of muscle or flesh, usually because of
            disease or lack of use. (2) A decline or degeneration.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; After a month in a hospital bed, my father required a round of physical
            therapy to deal with his muscular atrophy.
        </p>
        <p>From its literal Greek roots, atrophy would mean basically &ldquo;lack of
            nourishment.&rdquo; Although the English word doesn't usually imply any lack of
            food, it always refers to a wasting away. Those who have been bedridden for
            a period of time will notice that their muscles have atrophied. And muscular
            atrophy is a frequent result of such diseases as cancer and AIDS. We also use
            atrophy in a much more general sense. After being out of work a few years,
            you may find your work skills have atrophied; someone who's been living an
            isolated life may discover the same thing about his or her social skills; and a
            democracy can atrophy when its citizens cease to pay attention to how they're
            being governed.</p>

        <p>hypertrophy (1) Excessive development of an organ or part.
            (2) Exaggerated growth or complexity.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Opponents claimed that the Defense Department, after years of being given
            too much money by the Congress, was now suffering from hypertrophy.
        </p>
        <p>When the prefix hyper-, &ldquo;above, beyond&rdquo; (see HYPER), is joined to -trophy,
            we get the opposite of atrophy. An organ or part becomes hypertrophic when
            it grows so extremely that its function is affected. Muscle hypertrophy is
            common in men who do strength training, and is often harmless; but extreme
            muscle hypertrophy generally involves taking steroids, which can do great
            damage to the body. Hypertrophy of the heart sounds as if it might be
            healthy, but instead it's usually a bad sign. As the example sentence shows,
            hypertrophy, like atrophy, can be used in nonmedical ways as well.</p>

        <p>dystrophy Any of several disorders involving the nerves and
            muscles, especially muscular dystrophy.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The most common of the muscular dystrophies affects only males, who
            rarely live to the age of 40.
        </p>
        <p>Since the prefix dys- means &ldquo;bad&rdquo; or &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; (see DYS), dystrophy is
            always a negative term. Originally it meant &ldquo;a condition caused by improper
            nutrition,&rdquo; but today the term is instead used for a variety of other conditions,
            particularly conditions that noticeably affect the muscles. Of the many types
            of muscular dystrophy, the best known is Duchenne's, a terrible disease that
            strikes about one in 3,300 males and produces severe wasting of the muscles.
            However, the muscular dystrophies generally affect many other organs and
            systems as well. And the other dystrophies, which tend to involve the eyes or
            hands, don't much resemble the muscular dystrophies.</p>

        <p>eutrophication The process by which a body of
            water becomes enriched in dissolved nutrients.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Local naturalists are getting worried about the increasing eutrophication
            they've been noticing in the lake.
        </p>
        <p>Eutrophication, which comes from the Greek eutrophos, &ldquo;well-nourished&rdquo;
            (see EU), has become a major environmental problem. Nitrates and
            phosphates, especially from lawn fertilizers, run off the land into rivers and
            lakes, promoting the growth of algae and other plant life, which take oxygen
            from the water, causing the death of fish and mollusks. Cow manure,
            agricultural fertilizer, detergents, and human waste are often to blame as well.
            In the 1960s and '70s, the eutrophication of Lake Erie advanced so extremely
            that it became known as the &ldquo;dead lake.&rdquo; And many areas of the oceans
            worldwide&mdash;some more than 20,000 square miles in extent&mdash;have become
            &ldquo;dead zones,&rdquo; where almost no life of any kind exists.</p>

        <p>aeolian harp A box-shaped instrument with strings that
            produce musical sounds when the wind blows on them.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Poets have long been fascinated by the aeolian harp, the only instrument
            that produces music without a human performer.
        </p>
        <p>According to the ancient Greeks, Aeolus was the king or guardian of the
            winds. He lived in a cave with his many, many sons and daughters, and sent
            forth whatever wind Zeus asked for. When Odysseus stopped there on his
            way home from Troy, he received a bag of winds to fill his sails. But while
            he was asleep, his men, thinking it contained treasure, opened the bag and
            released the raging winds, which blew their ships all the way back to their
            starting point. An aeolian harp produces enchanting harmonies when the
            wind passes over it. According to Homer, it was the god Hermes who
            invented the harp, by having the wind blow over the dried sinews attached to
            the shell of a dead tortoise.</p>

        <p>&bull; Near the club's dance floor, a young rock star was hanging out, the cynosure
            of a small crowd of admirers.
        </p>
        <p>In Greek kynosoura means &ldquo;dog's tail,&rdquo; and in Latin Cynosura came to mean
            the constellation Ursa Minor (Little Bear)&mdash;what we usually call the Little
            Dipper. The first star on the dog's or bear's &ldquo;tail,&rdquo; or the dipper's &ldquo;handle,&rdquo; is
            Polaris, the North Star, long used as a guide for seamen or travelers lost on a
            clear night, since, unlike the other stars, it always remains in the same
            position in the northern sky, while the other constellations (and even the rest
            of its own constellation) slowly revolve around it. Since Cynosura also came
            to mean the star itself, the English cynosure now may mean both &ldquo;guide&rdquo; and
            &ldquo;center of attention.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&bull; Action-film scripts usually seem to call for laconic leading men who avoid
            conversation but get the job done.
        </p>
        <p>Ancient Sparta was located in the region of Greece known as Laconia, and
            the Greek word lakonikos could mean both &ldquo;Laconian&rdquo; and &ldquo;Spartan.&rdquo; The
            disciplined and militaristic Spartans, the finest warriors of their time, were
            known for putting up with extreme conditions without complaint. So English
            writers who knew their ancient history came to use laconic to describe the
            habit of saying few words. Today we can refer not only to a laconic person
            but also to laconic wit, a laconic answer, or a laconic phrase&mdash;such as &ldquo;Men
            of few words require few laws,&rdquo; uttered by a Spartan king.</p>

        <p>&bull; Sales-training courses recommend various mnemonic devices as a way of
            remembering peoples' names.
        </p>
        <p>The Greek word for memory is mnemosyne, and Mnemosyne was the
            goddess of memory and the mother of the Muses. So something that helps the
            memory is a mnemonic aid, or simply a mnemonic. Such traditional
            mnemonic devices as &ldquo;Every Good Boy Does Fine&rdquo; (for the notes on the
            lines of a musical staff with a treble clef) or the &ldquo;Thirty days hath September&rdquo;
            rhyme help to recall simple rules or complicated series that might otherwise
            slip away. (For extra credit, guess what &ldquo;King Henry Died Drinking
            Chocolate Milk&rdquo; or &ldquo;King Philip Could Only Find Green Socks&rdquo; stands for.)

        </p>
        <p>&bull; The male and female leads in sitcoms often keep their relationship platonic
            for the first few seasons, but romance almost always wins out in the end.
        </p>
        <p>The philosopher Plato presented his theories in a series of dramatic
            conversations between Socrates and other people, now called the &ldquo;Platonic
            dialogues.&rdquo; Among many other important concepts, he taught that everything
            here on earth is a pale imitation&mdash;like a shadow&mdash;of its ideal form, and this
            ideal form is now often called the &ldquo;platonic form.&rdquo; But platonic is probably
            usually seen in the phrase &ldquo;platonic love.&rdquo; Because Socrates (through Plato)
            teaches that the philosophical person should turn his passion for a lover into
            appreciation of beauty and love of a higher power and of the universe, close
            but nonsexual friendship between two people who might be thought to be
            romantically attracted is today known as platonic love or friendship.</p>

        <p>The poet Sappho wrote poems of self-reflection but also of passion, some of
            it directed to the women attending the school she conducted on the Greek
            island of Lesbos around 600 B.C. Even though most of the poems survive
            only as fragments, they have been greatly admired for many centuries. They
            were written in an original rhythmical pattern, which has become known as
            sapphic verse. Later admirers, such as the Roman poets Catullus and Horace,
            honored her by adopting the sapphic meter for their own poetry. Because of
            Sappho, the island of Lesbos also gave its name to lesbianism, which writers
            often used to call sapphic love.</p>

            disciple Plato, almost all of which claim to be accounts of Socrates'
            conversations with others. Today Socrates is best remembered for his method
            of teaching by asking increasingly difficult questions, the so-called Socratic
            method. This generally involves the use of Socratic induction, a way of
            gradually arriving at generalizations through a process of questions and
            answers, and Socratic irony, in which the teacher pretends ignorance while
            questioning his students skillfully to make them aware of their errors in
            understanding.</p>

        <p>In ancient Asia Minor (now Turkey), there was a city called Soloi where the
            inhabitants spoke Greek that was full of grammatical errors. So errors in
            grammar, and later also small errors in formal social behavior, came to be
            known (at least by intellectuals) as solecisms. The British magazine The
            Economist publishes a list of solecisms to be avoided in its prose, including
            the use of &ldquo;try and&rdquo; when you mean &ldquo;try to,&rdquo; &ldquo;hone in on&rdquo; when you mean
            &ldquo;home in on,&rdquo; and so forth. Social solecisms, such as mentioning how
            inferior the wine is to someone who turns out to be the hostess's sister, are
            more commonly called by a French name, faux pas.</p>

        <p>HER comes from the Latin verb haerere, meaning &ldquo;to stick.&rdquo; Another form
            of the verb produces the root hes-, seen in such words as adhesive, which
            means basically &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; or &ldquo;sticking,&rdquo; and hesitate, which means more or
            less &ldquo;stuck in one place.&rdquo;</p>

        </p>
        <p>Just as tape adheres to paper, a person may adhere to a cause, a faith, or a
            belief. Thus, you may be an adherent of Hinduism, an adherent of
            environmentalism, or an adherent of the Republican Party. A plan for cutting
            taxes always attracts adherents easily, regardless of what the cuts may result
            in.</p>

        <p>cohere To hold together firmly as parts of the same mass.

        <p>&bull; His novels never really cohere; the chapters always seem like separate short
            stories.
        </p>
        <p>When you finish writing a paper, you may feel that it coheres well, since it's
            sharply focused and all the ideas seem to support each other. When all the
            soldiers in an army platoon feel like buddies, the platoon has become a
            cohesive unit. In science class you may learn the difference between cohesion
            (the tendency of a chemical's molecules to stick together) and adhesion (the
            tendency of the molecules of two different substances to stick together).
            Water molecules tend to cohere, so water falls from the sky in drops, not as
            separate molecules. But water molecules also adhere to molecules of other
            substances, so raindrops will often cling to the underside of a clothesline for a
            while before gravity pulls them down.</p>

        <p>incoherent (1) Unclear or difficult to understand. (2)

        <p>&bull; The police had found him in an abandoned warehouse, and they reported
            that he was dirty, hungry, and incoherent.
        </p>
        <p>Incoherent is the opposite of coherent, and both commonly refer to words
            and thoughts. Just as coherent means well ordered and clear, incoherent
            means disordered and hard to follow. Incoherence in speech may result from
            emotional stress, especially anxiety or anger. Incoherence in writing may
            simply result from poor planning; a twelve-page term paper that isn't written
            until the night before it's due will generally suffer from incoherence.</p>

        <p>&bull; A guiding belief behind our Constitution is that individuals have certain
            inherent rights that can't be taken away.
        </p>
        <p>Inherent literally refers to something that is &ldquo;stuck in&rdquo; something else so
            firmly that they can't be separated. A plan may have an inherent flaw that will
            cause it to fail; a person may have inherent virtues that everyone admires.
            Since the flaw and the virtues can't be removed, the plan may simply have to
            be thrown out and the person will remain virtuous forever.</p>

        <p>&bull; Their favorite carnival ride was the Round-up, in which centrifugal force
            flattened them against the outer wall of a rapidly spinning cage.
        </p>
        <p>Centrifugal force is what keeps a string with a ball on the end taut when you
            whirl it around. A centrifuge is a machine that uses centrifugal force. At the
            end of a washing machine's cycle, it becomes a weak and simple centrifuge
            as it whirls the water out of your clothes. Centrifuges hundreds of thousands
            of times as powerful are essential to nuclear technology and drug
            manufacturing. Part of an astronaut's training occurs in a centrifuge that
            generates force equal to several times the force of gravity (about like a
            washing machine) to get them used to the forces they'll encounter in a real
            space mission.</p>

        <p>&bull; Caught in a storm by surprise, they took refuge in an abandoned barn.

        <p>The re- in refuge means basically &ldquo;back&rdquo; or &ldquo;backward&rdquo; rather than
            &ldquo;again&rdquo;
            (see RE-); thus, a refugee is someone who is &ldquo;fleeing backward.&rdquo; Refuge
            tends to appear with certain other words: you generally &ldquo;seek refuge,&rdquo; &ldquo;take
            refuge,&rdquo; or &ldquo;find refuge.&rdquo; Religion may be a refuge from the woes of your
            life; a beautiful park may be a refuge from the noise of the city; and your

        <p>fugue A musical form in which a theme is echoed and imitated by
            voices or instruments that enter one after another and interweave as the piece
            proceeds.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; For his debut on the church's new organ, the organist chose a fugue by J. S.
            Bach.
        </p>
        <p>Bach and Handel composed many fugues for harpsichord and organ in which
            the various parts (or voices) seem to flee from and chase each other in an
            intricate dance. Each part, after it has stated the theme or melody, apparently
            flees from the next part, which takes up the same theme and sets off in
            pursuit. Simple rounds such as &ldquo;Three Blind Mice&rdquo; or &ldquo;Row, Row, Row
            Your Boat&rdquo; could be called fugues for children, but a true fugue can be long
            and extremely complex.</p>

        <p>subterfuge (1) A trick designed to help conceal, escape, or
            evade. (2) A deceptive trick.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The conservatives' subterfuge of funding a liberal third-party candidate in
            order to take votes away from the main liberal candidate almost worked that
            year.
        </p>
        <p>With its &ldquo;flee&rdquo; root, the Latin verb subterfugere meant &ldquo;to escape or avoid.&rdquo;
            Thus, a subterfuge is a way of escaping blame, embarrassment,
            inconvenience&mdash;or even prison&mdash;by tricky means. The life of spies consists
            of an endless series of subterfuges. In the more everyday world, putting
            words like &ldquo;heart-healthy&rdquo; on junk-food packaging is a subterfuge to trick
            unwary shoppers. And getting a friend to call about an &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; in order
            to get out of an evening engagement is about the oldest subterfuge in the
            book.</p>

        <p>COSM comes from the Greek word for &ldquo;order.&rdquo; Since the Greeks believed
            the universe was an orderly place, words in this group usually relate to the
            universe. So cosmonaut was the word for a space traveler from the former
            Soviet Union. (The roots of our own word, astronaut, suggest &ldquo;star traveler&rdquo;
            instead.) Oddly enough, cosmetics comes from the same root, since putting
            things in order is similar to decorating something&mdash;such as your face.</p>

        <p>cosmos (1) The universe, especially when it is viewed as

        <p>&bull; The astronomer, the biologist, and the philosopher all try in their own ways
            to make sense of the cosmos.
        </p>
        <p>Cosmos often simply means &ldquo;universe.&rdquo; But the word is generally used to
            suggest an orderly or harmonious universe, as it was originally used by
            Pythagoras in the 6th century B.C. Thus, a religious mystic may help put us
            in touch with the cosmos, and so may a physicist. The same is often true of
            the adjective cosmic: Cosmic rays (really particles rather than rays) bombard
            us from outer space, but cosmic questions come from human attempts to find
            order in the universe.</p>

        <p>Most religions and cultures include some kind of cosmology to explain the
            nature of the universe. In modern astronomy, the leading cosmology is still
            the Big Bang theory, which claims that the universe began with a huge
            explosion that sent matter and energy spreading out in all directions. One
            reason why fans watch Star Trek is for the various cosmologies depicted in

        </p>
        <p>This word, which means literally &ldquo;non-knowledge,&rdquo; is only used by
            intellectuals, and the same is true of its adjective, nescient. We all have heard
            the remarkable facts: 40% of us believe that humans and dinosaurs lived on
            earth at the same time; 49% believe that the President can ignore the
            Constitution; 60% can't name the three branches of government; 75% can't
            find Israel on a map; and so on. Is it any wonder we Americans are
            sometimes called nescient?</p>

        <p>Being truly prescient would require supernatural powers. But well-informed
            people may have such good judgment as to appear prescient, and prescient is
            often used to mean &ldquo;having good foresight.&rdquo; Some newspaper columnists
            may seem prescient in their predictions, but we can't help suspecting that any
            apparent prescience is usually the result of leaks from people with inside

        <p>&bull; When the facts about how the cigarette industry had lied about its practices

        <p>Something that can't be done in good conscience is unconscionable, and such

            syllable word, unconscionable is actually quite common. This is partly
            because it isn't always used very seriously; so, for example, a critic is free to
            call a fat new book &ldquo;an unconscionable waste of trees.&rdquo; In law, an
            unconscionable contract is one that, even though it was signed by both

        <p>The meaning of juncture can be entirely physical; thus, you can speak of the
            juncture of the turnpike and Route 116, or the juncture of the Shenandoah
            and Potomac Rivers. But it more often means something nonphysical. This
            may be a moment in time, especially a moment when important events are
            &ldquo;crossing&rdquo; (&ldquo;At this critical juncture, the President called together his top

        </p>
        <p>With its prefix con-, meaning &ldquo;with, together,&rdquo; conjunct means basically
            &ldquo;joined together.&rdquo; A rather intellectual word, it has special meanings in music

            travels with thousands of others in the form of a kind of sailboat, blown
            across the ocean's surface with the wind; only later does each velella turn into

        <p>To be &ldquo;partial to&rdquo; or &ldquo;partial toward&rdquo; someone or something is to be

            really only sees part of the whole picture. To be impartial is the opposite. The
            United Nations sends impartial observers to monitor elections in troubled
            countries. We hope judges and juries will be impartial when they hand down

        <p>participle A word that is formed from a verb but used like
            an adjective.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In the phrase &ldquo;the crying child,&rdquo;&ldquo;crying&rdquo; is a present participle; in
            &ldquo;satisfaction guaranteed,&rdquo; &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; is a past participle.
        </p>
        <p>English verbs can take several basic forms, which we call their principal
            parts: the infinitive (&ldquo;to move,&rdquo; &ldquo;to speak,&rdquo; etc.), the past tense
            (&ldquo;moved,&rdquo;
            &ldquo;spoke&rdquo;), the past participle (&ldquo;moved,&rdquo; &ldquo;spoken&rdquo;), and the present
            participle
            (&ldquo;moving,&rdquo; &ldquo;speaking&rdquo;). The participles are words that &ldquo;take part&rdquo; in
            two
            different word classes: that is, verb forms that can also act like adjectives
            (&ldquo;the spoken word,&rdquo; &ldquo;a moving experience&rdquo;). A grammatical error called a
            dangling participle occurs when a sentence begins with a participle that
            doesn't modify the subject; in the sentence &ldquo;Climbing the mountain, the cabin
            came in view,&rdquo; for example, &ldquo;climbing&rdquo; is a dangling participle since it
            doesn't modify &ldquo;cabin.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>A partisan is someone who supports one part or party. Sometimes the support
            takes the form of military action, as when guerrilla fighters take on
            government forces. But partisan is actually most often used as an adjective,
            usually referring to support of a political party. so if you're accused of being
            too partisan, or of practicing partisan politics, it means you're mainly
            interested in boosting your own party and attacking the other one.</p>

            believed in other gods to Christianity. Wherever they went, the Catholic
            missionaries built central buildings for their religious work, and the buildings
            themselves became known as missions; many 17th-century missions in the
            American West and Southwest are now preserved as museums. Their foes,
            the Protestants, soon began sending out their own missionaries, and today

            to gather information. So a president may send a trusted emissary to a war-

            powerfully, or force. So you may feel compelled to speak to a friend about
            his drinking, or compelled to reveal a secret in order to prevent something
            from happening. A compulsion is usually a powerful inner urge; a compulsive
            shopper or a compulsive gambler usually can't hold onto money for long.
            You might not want to do something unless there's a compelling reason;
            however, a compelling film is simply one that seems serious and important.</p>

        <p>expel (1) To drive or force out. (2) To force to leave, usually by
            official action.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; For repeatedly ignoring important agreements over several years, the two
            countries were eventually expelled from the trade organization.
        </p>
        <p>To expel is to drive out, and its usual noun is expulsion. Expel is similar to
            eject, but expel suggests pushing out while eject suggests throwing out. Also,
            ejecting may only be temporary: the player ejected from a game may be back
            tomorrow, but the student expelled from school is probably out forever.</p>

        <p>impel To urge or drive forward by strong moral force.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; As the meeting wore on without any real progress being made, she felt
            impelled to stand and speak.
        </p>
        <p>Impel is very similar in meaning to compel, and often a perfect synonym,
            though it tends to suggest even more strongly an inner drive to do something
            and a greater urgency to act, especially for moral reasons. But when impel
            takes its noun and adjective forms, it changes slightly. So an impulse&mdash;such
            as &ldquo;impulse buying,&rdquo; when you suddenly see something cool and know
            you've got to have it&mdash;often isn't based on anything very serious. And
            impulsive behavior in general, such as blurting out something stupid on the
            spur of the moment, is the kind of thing you're supposed to get over when
            you grow up.</p>

        <p>&bull; Her son, knowing how she was repelled by rats and snakes, had started
            keeping them in his bedroom.
        </p>
        <p>Since re- can mean not just &ldquo;again&rdquo; but also &ldquo;back&rdquo; (see RE-), repel means
            &ldquo;drive back.&rdquo; Repel has two common adjective forms; thus, a repellent or
            repulsive odor may drive us into the other room. Its main noun form is
            repulsion. Magnets exhibit both attraction and repulsion, and the goal of an
            armed defense is the repulsion of an enemy; but we generally use repulsion to
            mean &ldquo;strong dislike.&rdquo; In recent years, repulse has been increasingly used as
            a synonym for repel (&ldquo;That guy repulses me&rdquo;).</p>

        <p>arachnid A member of the class Arachnida, which principally
            includes animals with four pairs of legs and no antennae, such as spiders,
            scorpions, mites, and ticks.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; His interest in arachnids began when, as a child, he would watch spiders
            build their gorgeous webs in the corners of the porch.
        </p>
        <p>The Greek word for &ldquo;spider&rdquo; is arachne, and, according to Greek mythology,
            the original arachnid was a girl named Arachne. A marvelous weaver, she
            made the mistake of claiming she was better at her craft than the goddess
            Athena. In a contest between the two, she angered the goddess by weaving a
            remarkable tapestry showing the gods behaving badly. As punishment,
            Athena changed Arachne into a spider, fated to spend her life weaving. With
            their eight legs, arachnids are easily distinguished from the six-legged
            insects, on which they feed by injecting digesting juices and then sucking up
            the liquefied remains.</p>

        <p>calliope A musical instrument similar to an organ in which
            whistles are sounded by steam or compressed air.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The town's old calliope, with its unmistakable sound, summoned them to
            the fair every summer.
        </p>
        <p>To the ancient Greeks, the Muses were nine goddesses, each of whom was
            the spirit of one or more of the arts and sciences. Calliope was the Muse of
            heroic or epic poetry, who inspired poets to write such epics as the Iliad and
            the Odyssey. Since the lengthy epics were generally sung from beginning to
            end, she was responsible for a great deal of musical reciting. But she wouldn't
            necessarily have approved of having her name used for the hooting organlike
            instrument that was invented in America around 1855. Calliopes gave a
            festive air to the great showboats that floated up and down the Mississippi
            and Ohio Rivers giving theatrical performances; the loudest could supposedly
            be heard eight miles away, attracting customers from all around. Today they
            are mostly heard on merry-go-rounds and at circuses.</p>

        <p>dryad A wood nymph.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The ancient Greeks' love of trees can be seen in their belief that every tree
            contained a dryad, which died when the tree was cut.
        </p>
        <p>The term dryad comes from the Greek word for &ldquo;oak tree.&rdquo; As the Greeks
            saw it, every tree (not only oaks) had a spirit. The best known of the dryads
            was Daphne. The beautiful daughter of a river god, she was desired by the
            god Apollo; as he was about to capture her, she prayed to her father to save
            her, and he transformed her into a laurel tree. In her honor, Apollo
            commanded that the poet who won the highest prize every year be crowned
            with a laurel wreath. The Greeks' respect for trees unfortunately failed to
            keep Greece's forests from shrinking greatly over the centuries, and those that
            remain produce little wood of good quality.</p>

            called fauns, were known for their love of pleasure and mischief. The fauna

            flowers in her hair, strewing flowers over the earth. English preserves her
            name in such words as floral, floret, and flourish. A region's flora may range

        <p>The hero Hercules, son of the god Zeus by a human mother, was famous for

            forced to perform twelve enormously difficult tasks, or &ldquo;labors.&rdquo; These
            ranged from descending into the underworld to bring back the terrifying dog

            policy would open a Pandora's box of economic problems.
        </p>
        <p>The god Prometheus stole fire from heaven to give to the human race, which
            originally consisted only of men. To punish humanity, the other gods created
            the first woman, the beautiful Pandora. As a gift, Zeus gave her a box, which
            she was told never to open. However, as soon as he was out of sight she took
            off the lid, and out swarmed all the troubles of the world, never to be
            recaptured. Only Hope was left in the box, stuck under the lid. Anything that
            looks ordinary but may produce unpredictable harmful results can thus be
            called a Pandora's box.</p>

            feel caught between Scylla and Charybdis.
        </p>
        <p>The Strait of Messina is the narrow passage between the island of Sicily and
            the &ldquo;toe&rdquo; of Italy's &ldquo;boot.&rdquo; In Greek mythology, two monsters hovered on
            either side of the strait. Scylla, a female monster with six snake-like heads,
            each with pointed teeth, barked like a dog from the rocks on the Italian side.
            Charybdis, on the Sicilian side, caused a whirlpool by swallowing the waters
            of the sea three times a day. When Odysseus attempted to sail between them,
            he encountered disaster on both sides. Being caught between Scylla and
            Charybdis is a lot like being between a rock and a hard place.</p>

        <p>PUT comes from the Latin verb putare, meaning &ldquo;to think, consider, or
            believe.&rdquo; So, for example, a reputation is what others think of you. But when
            the root shows up in such words as compute, dispute, and deputy, its meaning

        </p>
        <p>Reputed is used constantly today by reporters, and almost always to describe
            suspected criminals&mdash;&ldquo;the reputed mobster,&rdquo; &ldquo;the reputed drug kingpin,&rdquo;
            &ldquo;the
            reputed gang leader,&rdquo; etc. But the word shouldn't be left to journalists; your
            elderly aunt may, for instance, be reputed to have made a large fortune in oil,
            or to have had four husbands who all died mysteriously. Reputed is easy to
            confuse with reputable, and they used to mean the same thing&mdash;that is,

        <p>&bull; The family had fallen into disrepute after the conviction and imprisonment
            of his father and uncle.
        </p>
        <p>A reputation can be easy to lose, and someone who is no longer respectable
            may eventually find he's become genuinely disreputable&mdash;the kind of person
            that almost no one wants to be seen with. Disrepute isn't only for individuals:
            A company may fall into disrepute as a result of news stories about its
            products' defects; drug scandals have brought entire sports into disrepute; and
            a scientific theory may fall into disrepute as a result of new discoveries.</p>

        <p>Imputing something to someone (or something) usually means observing
            something invisible in that person (or thing). We may impute meaning to a
            play or novel, or to a casual remark by a friend, that was never intended.
            Many of us like to impute bad motives to others, while always regarding our
            own motives as pure. In tax law, imputed income is something that isn't
            actual money but might as well be&mdash;for example, the free use of a car lent to

            major is Human Physiology.
        </p>
        <p>The Latin root physio- generally means &ldquo;physical,&rdquo; so human physiology
            deals with just about everything that keeps us alive and working, and other
            physiology specialties do the same for other animals and for plants. To do
            anything serious in the field of health, you've obviously got to know how the
            body's organs and cells function normally. Physiology used to be considered
            separately from anatomy, which focuses on the body's structures; however,
            it's now known that structure and function can't easily be separated in a
            scientific way, so &ldquo;anatomy and physiology&rdquo; are often spoken of in the same

            family's political ideology.
        </p>
        <p>The root ideo-, as you might guess, means &ldquo;idea.&rdquo; Ideas and theories about
            human behavior can always be carried too far, since such behavior is very
            hard to pin down. So ideological thinkers&mdash;people who come up with large
            theories about how the world works and try to explain everything (and maybe
            even predict the future) according to those theories&mdash;are almost always
            disappointed, sooner or later, to find that it doesn't really work out. A person
            intensely devoted to a set of political ideas or theories can be called an
            ideologue&mdash;a translation of the French id&eacute;ologue, a word actually coined by

        <p>&bull; After his heart attack, he actually bought himself a cardiology textbook and

        </p>
        <p>The root card- (closely related to cord&mdash;see CORD) shows up in many heart-
            related words. Cardiologists frequently find themselves studying
            cardiograms, the charts of heart activity, made by machines called
            cardiographs. Heart attacks, and deaths caused by them, have both declined
            as a result of better medical emergency procedures, cholesterol-lowering
            drugs, and a decline in smoking. But the factors likely to actually improve
            heart health, such as better diets and more cardiovascular exercise (exercise,
            such as running, that improves the heart and blood vessels), haven't made any
            progress at all. So we should all be prepared to perform cardiopulmonary
            resuscitation (an emergency procedure done on someone whose heart has
            stopped, to get the heart and lungs working again).</p>

        <p>TERR comes from the Latin terra, &ldquo;earth.&rdquo; A territory is a large expanse of
            land. Terra firma is Latin for &ldquo;firm ground&rdquo; as opposed to the swaying seas.
            A terrace is a leveled area, often one created for farming on a sloping hill.
            And the French word for potato, pomme de terre, means literally &ldquo;apple of
            the earth.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&bull; The city's park boasts a beautiful parterre with many varieties of roses.
        </p>
        <p>Parterre comes to English by way of French, where it means &ldquo;on the
            ground.&rdquo; And in the early years of the theater, the parterre was truly on the
            ground. In Shakespeare's day, an English theater's parterre was the cheap
            standing-room area right in front of the stage, normally filled with rowdy
            spectators. The original idea of the French parterre garden, with its carefully
            designed plots and walkways, was to present an artistic pattern when seen
            from above&mdash;from a balcony, a raised terrace, or the top of an outdoor
            staircase. English gardeners responded with garden designs that tried to make
            their viewers half-forget that they were seeing something created by humans
            rather than untamed nature itself.</p>

            places where the pressure on the subterranean water is great enough, a hole

        <p>&bull; When no one was watching, they dropped their snake in the fifth-grade
            terrarium, and then waited in the hall to hear the screams.
        </p>
        <p>The turtle exhibit at a zoo is often in the form of a terrarium, as are some of
            the exhibits at a plant conservatory. In an ant terrarium, elementary-school
            students watch the ants dig their network of tunnels as if no one were
            watching. Terrariums try to create conditions as close as possible to a natural
            habitat. A covered terrarium can often sustain itself for months on the
            moisture trapped inside. But creating a good terrarium requires careful
            control not only of humidity but also of temperature, as well as good
            ventilation; the lighting should include the full spectrum of sunlight as well
            as a day-night regulator.</p>

        <p>Everything on or having to do with Earth can be called terrestrial. Mercury,

            Uranus, and Neptune. Something extraterrestrial comes from beyond the
            earth and its atmosphere; the word can be used to describe anything &ldquo;out of

        <p>PATH comes from the Greek word pathos, which means &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;suffering.&rdquo; So a pathetic sight moves us to pity, and a sympathetic friend
            &ldquo;feels with&rdquo; you when you yourself are suffering.</p>

        <p>pathos (1) An element in life or drama that produces sympathetic
            pity. (2) An emotion of sympathetic pity.

        <p>&bull; The pathos of the blind child beggars she had seen in India could still keep
            her awake at night.
        </p>
        <p>Pathos comes directly from Greek. According to Aristotle, the persuasive
            power of public speaking relies on three elements: the speaker's authority, the
            logic of the speech, and the speech's pathos. Aristotle claims that pathos is the
            appeal to the audience's sense of right and wrong, and that it is this (unlike
            authority and logic) that moves the audience's emotions. Today we usually
            speak of pathos as an element in fiction, film, drama, music, or even painting,
            or the real-life pathos of a situation or personality. Since pathos is closely
            related to pathetic, it's not surprising that, like pathetic, pathos may
            occasionally be used a bit sarcastically.</p>

        <p>apathetic (1) Showing or feeling little or no emotion. (2)

        </p>
        <p>&bull; His apathetic response to the victory bewildered his friends.
        </p>
        <p>Apathy, or lack of emotion, is central to Albert Camus's famous novel The
            Stranger, in which the main character's indifference toward almost
            everything, including his mother's death, results in his imprisonment. We feel
            little sympathy for him, and may even feel antipathy, or dislike. The
            American voter is often called apathetic; of all the industrial democracies,
            only in America does half the adult population fail to vote in major elections.
            As you can see, apathetic isn't the opposite of pathetic, even though the a-
            that it begins with means &ldquo;not&rdquo; or &ldquo;without.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>empathy The feeling of, or the ability to feel, the emotions
            and sensations of another.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Her maternal empathy was so strong that she often seemed to be living her
            son's life emotionally.
        </p>
        <p>In the 19th century, Charles Dickens counted on producing an empathetic
            response in his readers strong enough to make them buy the next newspaper
            installment of each novel. Today, when reading a novel such as A Tale of
            Two Cities, only the most hard-hearted reader could fail to feel empathy for
            Sidney Carton as he approaches the guillotine. One who empathizes suffers
            along with the one who feels the sensations directly. Empathy is similar to
            sympathy, but empathy usually suggests stronger, more instinctive feeling. So
            a person who feels sympathy, or pity, for victims of a war in Asia may feel
            empathy for a close friend going through the much smaller disaster of a
            divorce.</p>

        <p>telepathic Involving apparent communication from one

        </p>
        <p>&bull; After ten years of marriage, their communication is virtually telepathic, and
            each always seems to know what the other is thinking.
        </p>
        <p>Since tele- means &ldquo;distant&rdquo; (see TELE), you can see how telepathy means
            basically &ldquo;feeling communicated from a distance.&rdquo; The word was coined
            around 1880, when odd psychic phenomena were being widely discussed by
            people hoping that researchers might find a scientific basis for what they
            believed they themselves were experiencing. Today, when people talk about
            extrasensory perception, or ESP, telepathy is usually what they're talking
            about. In recent years, the notion of memes&mdash;ideas that might somehow
            physically fly from brain to brain so that people all over the world might have
            the same idea at about the same time without any obvious communication&mdash;
            has been widely discussed. Even though scientists haven't been able to
            establish the existence of telepathy, about 30% of Americans continue to
            believe in it.</p>

        <p>&bull; The classic novels Les Mis&eacute;rables and The Count of Monte Cristo portray
            the terrible conditions in French penal institutions in the 19th century.
        </p>
        <p>A state or country's penal code defines its crimes and describes its
            punishments. During the 18th and 19th centuries, many countries established
            penal colonies, where criminals were sent as punishment. Often these were
            unbearably severe; but it was to such colonies that some of Australia's and the
            United States' early white inhabitants came, and the convicts provided labor
            for the European settlement of these lands.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Impunity is protection from punishment, just as immunity is protection from
            disease. Tom Sawyer, in Mark Twain's novel, broke his Aunt Polly's rules
            with near impunity because he could usually sweet-talk her into forgiving
            him; if that failed, he had enjoyed himself so much he didn't care what

        <p>penance An act of self-punishment or religious devotion to show
            sorrow or regret for sin or wrongdoing.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In the Middle Ages bands of pilgrims would trudge to distant holy sites as
            penance for their sins.
        </p>
        <p>Penance as a form of apology for a mistake can be either voluntary or ordered
            by someone else. Many religions include penance among the ways in which
            believers can show repentance or regret for a misdeed. The Christian season
            of Lent, 40 days long, is traditionally a time for doing penance.</p>

        <p>punitive Giving, involving, or aiming at punishment.

        <p>&bull; The least popular teachers are usually the ones with punitive attitudes, those
            who seem to enjoy punishing more than teaching.
        </p>
        <p>Punitive is an important word in the law. When you sue a person or company
            for having wronged you in some way, you normally ask for something of
            value equal to what you were deprived of by the other party. But when the
            defendant has done something particularly bad, you may also ask for punitive
            damages, money over and above the actual cost of the harm done, intended to
            teach the defendant a lesson. Punitive damages are fairly rare, but when
            they're actually granted they may be as much as four times the size of the
            basic damages.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Maternity is used as both a noun and an adjective. Maternity benefits are
            benefits specially provided by employers for women having babies, and
            usually include maternity leave, time off work. With maternity come
            maternal feelings, which are shown by all species of warm-blooded animals

            estate by the matriarch.
        </p>
        <p>A matriarchy is a social unit governed by a woman or group of women. It
            isn't certain that a true matriarchal society has ever existed, so matriarchy is
            usually treated as an imaginative concept. But there are societies in which
            relatedness through women rather than men is stressed, and elements of
            matriarchy may be stronger in certain societies than they are in most of the
            Western world. And most of us can point to families in which a woman has
            become the dominant figure, or grande dame, or matriarch.</p>

            matrilineal connections.
        </p>
        <p>A person's lineage is his or her line of ancestors. So matrilineal means
            basically &ldquo;through the mother's line,&rdquo; just as patrilineal means &ldquo;through the
            father's line.&rdquo; Matrilineality is an important concept in anthropology; among
            other things, it usually determines who will inherit property on a person's
            death. Though families that follow the European model take the father's name
            and are therefore patrilineal, matrilineal societies have existed around the

            for producing other plants. In English the word has taken on many related
            meanings. Mathematicians use it for a rectangular organization of numbers or
            symbols that can be used to make various calculations; geologists use it for
            the soil or rock in which a fossil is discovered, like a baby in the womb. And

        <p>cereal (1) A plant that produces grain that can be eaten as food, or
            the grain it produces. (2) The food made from grain.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Rice is the main food cereal of Asia, whereas wheat and corn are the main
            food cereals of the West.
        </p>
        <p>The Roman goddess Ceres, the equivalent of the Greek Demeter, was a calm
            goddess who didn't take part in the quarrels of the other gods. Her particular
            responsibility was the food-giving plants, and for that reason the food grains
            came to carry her name. Cereals of the ancient Romans included wheat,
            barley, spelt, oats, and millet&mdash;but not corn (maize), which was a cereal of
            the Americas.</p>

        <p>Junoesque Having mature, poised, and dignified beauty.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In 1876, as a centennial gift, the French sent to America a massive statue of
            a robed Junoesque figure representing Liberty, to be erected in New York
            Harbor.
        </p>
        <p>Juno was the wife of Jupiter, the chief of the Roman gods. As the first among
            goddesses, her power gave her particular dignity; and as goddess of women
            and marriage, she was a mature matron. But such younger goddesses as
            Diana, goddess of the hunt, perhaps came closer to today's ideals of slim and
            athletic female beauty.</p>

        <p>Mars was the Roman god of war and one of the patron gods of Rome itself.
            He was responsible for everything military, from warriors to weapons to

            practiced as sport. When martial law is declared, a country's armed forces
            take over the functions of the police. And a court-martial is a military court

        <p>Promethean New or creative in a daring way.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Beginning in the 1950s, the little Asian countries of South Korea, Taiwan,
            and Singapore began to display a Promethean energy that would become one
            of the marvels of the modern world.
        </p>
        <p>Prometheus was a Titan, a generation older than Zeus. When Zeus overthrew
            his own father Cronus and seized power, Prometheus fought on the side of
            the gods and against his fellow Titans. But when Zeus later wanted to destroy
            the race of humans, Prometheus saved them by stealing fire for them from the
            gods. He also taught them how to write, farm, build houses, read the stars and
            weather, cure themselves when sick, and tame animals&mdash;in short, all the arts
            and skills that make humans unique. So inventive was he that anything of
            great creativity and originality can still be called Promethean. But
            Prometheus had taken a terrible risk; enraged by his disobedience, Zeus had
            him chained to a rocky cliff, where for many long centuries an eagle daily
            tore at his liver.</p>

        <p>Sisyphean Endless and difficult, involving many
            disappointments.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; After twenty years, many researchers had begun to think that defeating the
            virus was a Sisyphean task that would never succeed.
        </p>
        <p>Reputedly the cleverest man on earth, King Sisyphus of Corinth tricked the
            gods into bringing him back to life after he had died. For this they punished
            him by sending him back to the underworld, where he must eternally roll a
            huge rock up a long, steep hill, only to watch it roll back to where he started.
            Something Sisyphean demands the same kind of unending, thankless, and
            ultimately unsuccessful efforts.</p>

        <p>titanic Having great size, strength, or power; colossal.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The titanic floods of 1993 destroyed whole towns on the Mississippi River.
        </p>
        <p>In Greek mythology, the Titans were the generation of giant creators that
            produced the younger, stronger, cleverer gods, who soon overpowered and
            replaced them (see Promethean above). In 1911 the largest ship that had ever
            been built was christened the Titanic for its unmatched size and strength. But
            the name may have proved unlucky; on its maiden voyage in 1912 a massive
            iceberg ripped a fatal hole in the great ship, and it sank in the icy waters off
            Newfoundland.</p>

        <p>Triton (1) A being with a human upper body and the lower body of
            a fish; a merman. (2) Any of various large mollusks with a heavy, conical
            shell.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In one corner of the painting, a robust Triton emerges from the sea with his
            conch to announce the coming of the radiant queen.
        </p>
        <p>Triton was originally the son of the sea god Poseidon (or Neptune). A
            guardian of the fish and other creatures of the sea, he is usually shown as
            hearty, muscular, and cheerful. Like his father, he often carries a trident
            (three-pronged fork) and may ride in a chariot drawn by seahorses. Blowing
            on his conch shell, he creates the roar of the ocean. As a decorative image,
            Tritons are simply the male version of mermaids. The handsome seashells
            that bear their name are the very conchs on which they blow. Triton has also
            given his name to the planet Neptune's largest moon.</p>

        <p>vulcanize To treat crude or synthetic rubber or plastic so that it
            becomes elastic and strong and resists decay.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The native islanders had even discovered how to vulcanize the rubber from
            the local trees in a primitive way.
        </p>
        <p>The Roman god Vulcan (the Greek Hephaestus) was in charge of fire and the
            skills that use fire, especially blacksmithing. When Charles Goodyear almost
            accidentally discovered how to vulcanize rubber in 1839, he revolutionized
            the rubber industry. He called his process vulcanization because it used fire to
            heat a mix of rubber and sulfur. Vulcanized rubber was soon being used for
            shoes and other products, and in the Civil War balloons made of this new,
            stronger rubber carried Union spies over the Confederate armies. The
            material's importance increased greatly over the years, and today vulcanized
            rubber remains in use for automobile tires and numerous other products.</p>

        <p>CANT from the Latin verb cantare, meaning &ldquo;sing,&rdquo; produces several words
            that come directly from Latin. But some others came to English by way of
            French, which added an h to the root, giving us such words as chant and
            chantey.</p>

        <p>cantata A musical composition, particularly a religious work
            from the 17th or 18th century, for one or more voices accompanied by
            instruments.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Composers of the 18th century composed sacred cantatas by the dozen, and
            Bach's friend G. P. Telemann actually wrote over a thousand.
        </p>
        <p>A cantata is sung, unlike a sonata, which is played on instruments only. The
            most famous cantatas are by Johann Sebastian Bach, who wrote the music for
            about 200 religious cantatas, using hymns and new religious poems as his
            texts. His cantatas consisted of several different sections for different voices
            &mdash;solos, duets, and choruses. Some of his nonreligious cantatas have been
            performed like mini-operas.</p>

        <p>incantation (1) A use of spells or verbal charms spoken
            or sung as part of a ritual of magic. (2) A formula of words used in, or as if
            in, such a ritual.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; He repeated the words slowly over and over like an incantation.
        </p>
        <p>Incantation comes directly from the Latin word incantare, &ldquo;enchant.&rdquo;
            Incantare itself has cantare as a root, which reminds us that magic and ritual
            have always been associated with chanting and music. Incantations have
            often been in strange languages; &ldquo;Abracadabra&rdquo; is a not-so-serious version of
            an incantation.</p>

        <p>cantor An official of a Jewish synagogue who sings or chants the

        <p>&bull; The congregation waited for the cantor to begin the prayers before joining
            in.
        </p>
        <p>The cantor is, after the rabbi, the most important figure in a Jewish worship
            service. A cantor not only must possess an excellent singing voice but also
            must know by heart long passages of Hebrew. Cantors such as Jan Peerce and
            Richard Tucker became international opera stars. The comedian and singer
            Edward Israel Iskowitz renamed himself Eddie Cantor for his original
            profession and became enormously popular on stage, screen, radio, and
            television for over 40 years.</p>

        <p>The prefix des-, meaning &ldquo;two&rdquo; or &ldquo;apart,&rdquo; indicates that the descant is a

        <p>LINGU comes from the Latin word that means both &ldquo;tongue&rdquo; and

            native tongue&rdquo;). Our expression &ldquo;slip of the tongue&rdquo; is just a translation of
            the Latin phrase lapsus linguae. The root even shows up in a slangy-sounding
            word like lingo. And since lingu- changed to langu- in French, our word

            themselves to analyzing the structure of language. Many linguists concentrate
            on the history of a language; others study the way children learn to speak;
            others analyze the sounds of a language&mdash;and still others just study English
            grammar, a subject so big that you could easily spend your entire life on it.</p>

            German and Polish he had grown up speaking but in English and Arabic as
            well.
        </p>
        <p>The roots of multilingual come from Latin (see MULTI). If you happen to
            prefer Greek, use the synonym polyglot, in which poly- has the same meaning
            as multi-, and -glot means the same thing as -lingual. The best way to become
            multilingual is probably to be born in a bilingual (two-language) household;
            learning those first two seems to give the mind the kind of exercise that
            makes later language-learning easy.</p>

        <p>In the Middle Ages, the Arabs of the eastern Mediterranean referred to all
            Europeans as Franks (the name of the tribe that once occupied the land we
            call France). Since there was plenty of Arab-European trade, the traders in the
            Mediterranean ports eventually developed a trading language combining
            Italian, Arabic, and other languages, which almost everyone could more or
            less understand, and it became known as the &ldquo;Frankish language,&rdquo; or lingua
            franca. Some languages actually succeed in becoming lingua francas without
            changing much. So, when the Roman empire became vast and mighty, Latin
            became the important lingua franca; and at a meeting between Japanese and
            Vietnamese businesspeople today, English may well be the only language
            spoken.</p>

        <p>SPIR comes from the Latin words meaning &ldquo;breath&rdquo; and &ldquo;breathe.&rdquo; When we

            new energy and imagination into them. When you expire, or die, you
            &ldquo;breathe out&rdquo; your soul in your last breath. A license, membership, credit

        <p>Respiration means simply &ldquo;breathing.&rdquo; We usually come across the word in
            artificial respiration, the lifesaving technique in which you force air into the
            lungs of someone who's stopped breathing. Respirators can take several
            different forms. Scuba-diving equipment always includes a respirator, though
            it doesn't actually do the breathing for the diver. Medical respirators, which
            are used especially for babies and for emergency care and actually take over
            the job of getting oxygen into the lungs, are today usually called ventilators,
            so as to distinguish them from simple oxygen systems (which merely provide
            a steady flow of oxygen into the nostrils) and face masks.</p>

            through a surface such as a leaf. From there, it came to mean also the gradual
            appearance of previously secret information, as if leaking out of the pores of
            a leaf (as in &ldquo;It transpired that she was not only his employee but also his

            century A.D., but a commercially practical steam turbine wasn't developed
            until 1884; steam turbines are now the main elements of electric power
            stations. Jet engines are gas turbines. A turbojet engine uses a turbine to
            compress the incoming air that feeds the engine before being ejected to push
            the plane forward; a turboprop engine uses its exhaust to drive a turbine that
            spins a propeller. A wind turbine generates electricity by being turned by the

        </p>
        <p>Some people lead turbulent lives, and some are constantly in the grip of
            turbulent emotions. The late 1960s are remembered as turbulent years of
            social revolution in America and Europe. Often the captain of an airplane will
            warn passengers to fasten their seatbelts because of upper-air turbulence,
            which can make for a bumpy ride. El Ni&ntilde;o, a seasonal current of warm water
            in the Pacific Ocean, may create turbulence in the winds across the United
            States, affecting patterns of rainfall and temperature as well.</p>

        <p>VOLU/VOLV comes from the Latin verb volvere, meaning &ldquo;to roll, wind,

        <p>A voluble person has words &ldquo;rolling&rdquo; off his or her tongue. In O. Henry's

        <p>devolve ((1) To pass (responsibility, power, etc.) from one person
            or group to another person or group at a lower level of authority. (2) To
            gradually go from an advanced state to a less advanced state.

        <p>&bull; Since 1998, considerable power has been devolving from the British
            government in London to the new Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.
        </p>
        <p>With its de- prefix (see DE), devolution implies moving backward. Once
            powers have been centralized in a unified government, giving any powers
            back&mdash;that is, devolving the power&mdash;to a smaller governmental unit can seem
            to be reversing a natural development. In a somewhat similar way, a job that
            your boss doesn't want to do may devolve upon you. But devolve and
            devolution are also treated nowadays as the opposites of evolve and evolution.
            So we may also speak of moral devolution, such as occurred in Germany in
            the 1930s, when a country with an extraordinary culture became a brutal
            dictatorship. And parents may watch their slacker teenager and wonder if
            devolution is occurring right in front of their eyes.</p>

            long after dinosaurs were extinct. Evolution can also be used more broadly to
            refer to technology, society, and other human creations. For example, an idea
            may evolve, even in your own mind, as the months or years pass. And though
            many people don't believe that human beings truly become better with the
            passing centuries, many will argue that our societies tend to evolve,

        <p>&bull; The lumen is a measure of the perceived power of light.
        </p>
        <p>There are two common units for measuring light, the candela and the lumen.
            Both are recognized as standard international units, which also include the
            second (for time), the kilogram (for weight), and the meter (for length). The
            candela is a measure of intensity; an ordinary candle gives off light with the
            intensity of about one candela. The lumen is a measure of &ldquo;luminous flux&rdquo;; a
            standard 100-watt lightbulb gives off 1500&ndash;1700 lumens. Luminous flux
            indicates how much light is actually perceived by the human eye.
            Technologies vary in how efficiently they turn electricity into light; halogen
            lights produce about 12 lumens per watt, ordinary incandescent lightbulbs
            produce about 15 lumens per watt, and compact fluorescent bulbs produce

            Muse to inspire him, and a poem itself might begin with such a call; thus,
            Homer's Odyssey begins, &ldquo;Sing to me of the man, Muse&rdquo; (that is, of
            Odysseus). Today a muse may be one's special creative spirit, but some

        <p>Odysseus was away from home fighting and journeying for 20 years,
            according to Homer. During that time, the son he left as a babe in arms grew
            up under the supervision of Mentor, an old and trusted friend. When the
            goddess Athena decided it was time to complete young Telemachus's
            education by sending him off to learn about his father, she visited him
            disguised as Mentor and they set out together. Today, anyone such as a coach
            or tutor who gives another (usually younger) person help and advice on how
            to achieve success in the larger world is called a mentor. And in recent years
            we've even been using the word as a verb, and now in business we often
            speak of an experienced employee mentoring someone who has just arrived.</p>

        <p>narcissism (1) Extreme self-centeredness or fascination
            with oneself. (2) Love or desire for one's own body.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; His girlfriend would complain about his narcissism, saying he spent more
            time looking at himself in the mirror than at her.
        </p>
        <p>Narcissus was a handsome youth in Greek mythology who inspired love in
            many who saw him. One was the nymph Echo, who could only repeat the last
            thing that anyone said. When Narcissus cruelly rejected her, she wasted away
            to nothing but her voice. Though he played with the affections of others,
            Narcissus became a victim of his own attractiveness. When he caught sight of
            his own reflection in a pool, he sat gazing at it in fascination, wasting away
            without food or drink, unable to touch or kiss the image he saw. When he
            finally died, the gods turned him into the flower we call the narcissus, which
            stands with its head bent as though gazing at its reflection. People with
            &ldquo;narcissistic personality disorder&rdquo; have a somewhat serious mental condition,
            according to psychologists, but the rest of us are free to call anyone who
            seems vain and self-centered a narcissist.</p>

        <p>King Tantalus, according to Greek mythology, killed his son Pelops and
            served him to the gods in a stew for dinner. Almost all the gods realized what
            was happening and refused the meal, though only after Demeter had taken a
            nibble out of Pelops's shoulder. After they had reconstructed him, replacing
            the missing shoulder with a piece of ivory, they turned to punishing Tantalus.
            In Hades he stands in water up to his neck under a tree laden with fruit. Each
            time he stoops to drink, the water moves out of reach; each time he reaches
            up to pick something, the branches move beyond his grasp. He is thus
            eternally tantalized by the water and fruit. Today anything or anyone that
            tempts but is unobtainable is tantalizing.</p>

        <p>thespian An actor.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In summer the towns of New England welcome troupes of thespians
            dedicated to presenting plays of all kinds.
        </p>
        <p>Greek drama was originally entirely performed by choruses. According to
            tradition, the Greek dramatist Thespis, of the 6th century B.C., was the
            inventor of tragedy and the first to write roles for the individual actor as
            distinct from the chorus, and the actor's exchanges with the chorus were the
            first dramatic dialogue. Since Thespis himself performed the individual parts
            in his own plays, he was also the first true actor. Ever since choruses
            disappeared from drama, thespians have filled all the roles in plays. Thespian
            is also an adjective; thus, we can speak of &ldquo;thespian ambitions&rdquo; and &ldquo;thespian
            traditions,&rdquo; for example.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The ancient Greeks called the west wind Zephyrus and regarded him and his
            fellows&mdash;Boreas (god of the north wind), Eurus (god of the east wind), and
            Notus (god of the south wind)&mdash;as gods. A zephyr is a kind wind, bringer of

        <p>UMBR comes from the Latin umbra, meaning &ldquo;shadow.&rdquo; Thus, the familiar
            umbrella, with its ending meaning &ldquo;little,&rdquo; casts a &ldquo;little shadow&rdquo; to keep off

        <p>umber (1) A darkish brown mineral containing manganese and

            reddish brown.

        <p>The mineral deposits of Italy provided sources of a number of natural
            pigments, among them umber. Since the late Renaissance, umber has been in
            great demand as a coloring agent. When crushed and mixed with paint, it
            produces an olive color known as raw umber; when crushed and burnt, it
            produces a darker tone known as burnt umber.</p>

        </p>
        <p>A synonym for adumbrate is foreshadow, which means to present a shadowy
            version of something before it becomes reality or is provided in full. Tough
            questioning by a Supreme Court justice may adumbrate the way he or she is
            planning to rule on a case. A bad review by a critic may adumbrate the failure
            of a new film. And rats scurrying off a ship were believed to adumbrate a

        <p>penumbra (1) The partial shadow surrounding a complete

            exists less fully.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>Every solar eclipse casts an umbra, the darker central area in which almost no
            light reaches the earth, and a penumbra, the area of partial shadow where part
            of the sun is still visible. Penumbra can thus be used to describe any &ldquo;gray
            area&rdquo; where things aren't all black and white. For example, the right to
            privacy falls under the penumbra of the U.S. Constitution; though it isn't
            specifically guaranteed there, the Supreme Court has held that it is implied,
            and thus that the government may not intrude into certain areas of a citizen's
            private life. Because its existence is still shadowy, however, the Court is still
            determining how much of an individual's life is protected by the right to
            privacy.</p>

        </p>
        <p>An umbrage was originally a shadow, and soon the word also began to mean
            &ldquo;a shadowy suspicion.&rdquo; Then it came to mean &ldquo;displeasure&rdquo; as well&mdash;that is,
            a kind of shadow blocking the sunlight. Umbrage is now generally used in
            the phrase &ldquo;take umbrage at.&rdquo; An overly sensitive person may take umbrage
            at something as small as having his or her name pronounced wrong.</p>

            may divest itself of several stores, and investors are constantly divesting
            themselves of stocks that aren't performing well enough. And when it turns

        <p>investiture The formal placing of someone in office.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; At an English monarch's investiture, he or she is presented with the crown,
            scepter, and sword, the symbols of power.
        </p>
        <p>In its original meaning, an investiture was the clothing of a new officeholder
            in garments that symbolized power. The Middle Ages saw much debate over
            the investiture of bishops by kings and emperors. These rulers felt that high
            religious offices were theirs to give as rewards for someone's loyal service or
            as bribes for someone's future support; the popes, on the other hand, regarded
            these investitures as the improper buying and selling of church offices. The
            investiture struggle caused tension between popes and monarchs and even led
            to wars.</p>

        <p>transvestite A person, especially a male, who wears the
            clothing and adopts the mannerisms of the opposite sex.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In Handel's operas, the heroic male leading roles are today often sung by
            female transvestites, since he originally wrote them for the soprano range.
        </p>
        <p>Transvestite includes the prefix trans-, &ldquo;across,&rdquo; and thus means literally
            &ldquo;cross-dresser.&rdquo; In the theater, from ancient Greece to Elizabethan England,
            transvestism was common because all parts&mdash;even Juliet&mdash;were played by
            men. Traditional Japanese Kabuki and Noh drama still employ transvestism
            of this sort. In everyday life, it's now so acceptable for women to wear men's
            clothing that the word transvestite is generally applied only to men. The
            much newer word transgender describes people who think of themselves as
            having changed sex, or who simply don't believe in the idea that they're either
            one sex or the other.</p>

        <p>travesty (1) An inferior or distorted imitation. (2) A broadly
            comic imitation in drama, literature, or art that is usually grotesque and
            ridiculous.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The senator was shouting that the new tax bill represented a travesty of tax
            reform.
        </p>
        <p>The word travesty comes from the same prefix and root as transvestite. Since
            cross-dressing often isn't very convincing, the word has usually referred to
            something absurd. So a verdict that angers people may be denounced as a
            &ldquo;travesty of justice.&rdquo; Saturday Night Live specializes in dramatic travesties
            mocking everything from political figures and issues to popular culture
            &mdash;&ldquo;disguised&rdquo; versions intended for entertainment. Travesty may also be a
            verb; thus, Mel Brooks has travestied movie genres of all kinds&mdash;westerns,
            thrillers, and silent films, among others.</p>

        <p>THE/THEO comes from the Greek word meaning &ldquo;god.&rdquo; Theology, the
            study of religion, is practiced by theologians. Monotheism is the worship of a
            single god; Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are monotheistic religions, and
            all three worship the same god. Polytheistic religions such as those of ancient
            Greece and Rome, on the other hand, worship many gods.</p>

        <p>apotheosis (1) Transformation into a god. (2) The

        </p>
        <p>&bull; Abraham Lincoln's apotheosis after his assassination transformed the
            controversial politician into the saintly savior of his country.
        </p>
        <p>In ancient Greece, historical figures were sometimes worshipped as gods. In
            Rome, apotheosis was rare until the emperor Augustus declared the dead
            Julius Caesar to be a god, and soon other dead emperors were being
            apotheosized as well. In older paintings you may see a heroic figure&mdash;
            Napoleon, George Washington, or Shakespeare, for example&mdash;being raised
            into the clouds, symbolizing his or her apotheosis. But today any great classic
            example of something can be called its apotheosis. You might hear it said, for
            example, that Baroque music reached its apotheosis in the works of J. S.
            Bach, or that the Duesenberg Phaeton was the apotheosis of the touring car.</p>

        <p>atheistic Denying the existence of God or divine power.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The atheistic Madalyn Murray O'Hair successfully sought the removal of
            prayer from American public schools in the 1960s.
        </p>
        <p>In the Roman Empire, early Christians were called atheistic because they
            denied the existence of the Roman gods. And once the Christian church was
            firmly established, it condemned the Romans as atheists because they didn't
            believe in the Christian God. In later centuries, English-speaking Christians
            would often use the words pagan and heathen to describe such non-
            Christians, while atheist would be reserved for those who actually denied the
            existence of any god. Atheism is different from agnosticism, which claims
            that the existence of any higher power is unknowable; and lots of people who
            simply don't think much about religion often call themselves agnostics as
            well.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Each of the important Roman gods and goddesses had many temples erected
            in their name. But in 27 B.C. a temple to all the gods together was completed
            in Rome; twice destroyed, it was ultimately replaced by a third temple around
            A.D. 126. This extraordinary domed structure is still one of the important
            sights of Rome, and the burial place for the painters Raphael and Carracci
            and two kings. In Paris, a great church was completed in 1789&ndash;90; named the
            Panth&eacute;on, it was announced as the future resting place of France's great
            figures, and the bodies of Victor Hugo, Louis Pasteur, Marie Curie, and many

        <p>In the Middle Ages, the Muslim empires stretching around much of the
            Mediterranean were theocracies, and the pope ruled most of modern-day
            Italy. But theocracies are rare today. Modern Iran and Saudi Arabia (and
            perhaps half a dozen others) are usually regarded as theocratic governments,
            since, even though Iran's president is elected by popular vote and Saudi
            Arabia is ruled by a royal family, the countries' laws are religious laws. But
            when a government tries to follow all the teachings of a single religion,
            things usually don't work out terribly well, so U.S. Constitution and Bill of

        <p>ICON comes from the Greek eikon, which led to the Latin icon, both
            meaning &ldquo;image.&rdquo; Though the icon- root hasn't produced many English
            words, the words that is does appear in tend to be interesting.</p>

        <p>icon (1) A religious image usually painted on a small wooden panel:
            idol. (2) Emblem, symbol.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Henry Ford's assembly line captured the imagination of the world, and he
            and his company became icons of industrial capitalism.
        </p>
        <p>In the Eastern Orthodox church, much importance is given to icons, usually
            small portraits on wood&mdash;sometimes with gold-leaf paint&mdash;of Jesus, Mary, or
            a saint, which hang in churches and in the houses of the faithful. The
            Orthodox church favors icons partly because they communicate directly and
            forcefully even to uneducated people. They are regarded as sacred; some
            believers actually pray to them, and many believe that icons have carried out
            miracles. The common modern uses of icon grew out of this original sense.
            The fact that Orthodox icons have a symbolic role led to icon being used to
            mean simply &ldquo;symbol.&rdquo; Because of the icon's sacredness, the term also came
            to mean &ldquo;idol.&rdquo; And once we began to use idol to refer to pop-culture stars, it
            wasn't long before we began using icon the same way. But for the little
            computer-desktop images that you click on, the older meaning of &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; is
            the one we're thinking of.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The original meaning of iconic was essentially &ldquo;resembling an icon,&rdquo; but
            today it more often seems to mean &ldquo;so admired that it could be the subject of
            an icon.&rdquo; And with that meaning, iconic has become part of the language of
            advertising and publicity; today companies and magazines and TV hosts are
            constantly encouraging us to think of some consumer item or pop star or
            show as first-rate or immortal or flawless&mdash;absolutely &ldquo;iconic&rdquo;&mdash;when he or

        <p>&bull; She's always rattling her friends by saying outrageous things, and she
            enjoys her reputation as an iconoclast.
        </p>
        <p>When the early books of the Bible were being written, most of the other
            Middle Eastern religions had more than one god; these religions generally
            encouraged the worship of idols of the various gods, which were often
            regarded as magical objects. But in the Ten Commandments given to Moses
            in the Old Testament, God prohibits the making of &ldquo;graven images&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;idols&rdquo; for worship, proclaiming that the Jews are to worship only one God,
            who is too great to be represented in an idol. However, by the 6th century
            A.D., Christians had begun to create religious images in order to focus the
            prayers of the faithful. Opposition to icons led to the Iconoclastic
            Controversy in A.D. 726, when, supported by the pope, iconoclasts began
            smashing and burning the images in churches and monasteries (clast- comes
            from the Greek word meaning &ldquo;to break&rdquo;). In time, peace was restored, and
            almost all Christians have since accepted depictions of Jesus, Mary, and the
            saints. Today an iconoclast is someone who constantly argues with
            conventional thinking, refusing to &ldquo;worship&rdquo; the objects of everyone else's
            &ldquo;faith.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&bull; Today scholars pore over the advertisements in glossy magazines, studying
            the iconography for clues to the ads' hidden meanings.

        <p>If you saw a 17th-century painting of a man writing at a desk with a lion at
            his feet, would you know you were looking at St. Jerome, translator of the
            Bible, who, according to legend, once pulled a thorn from the paw of a lion,
            which thereafter became his devoted friend? And if a painting showed a
            young woman reclining on a bed with a shower of gold descending on her,
            would you recognize her as Dana&euml;, locked up in a tower to keep her away
            from the lustful Zeus, who then managed to gain access to her by
            transforming himself into golden light (or golden coins)? An iconographic
            approach to art can make museum-going a lot of fun&mdash;and amateur
            iconographers know there are also plenty of symbols lurking in the images

            parties.
        </p>
        <p>Urbane's synonyms include suave, debonair, and especially cosmopolitan.
            Urbanity was a trait of such classic movie stars as Fred Astaire, Cary Grant,
            William Powell, Leslie Howard, Charles Boyer, and George Sanders. (Notice
            that, for some reason, urbane is almost always used to describe men rather
            than women.) Teenagers in the 1960s read James Bond novels and watched
            his character onscreen to get tips about acquiring an urbane identity. But it's
            hard to acquire urbanity without actually having had wide social experience
            in sophisticated cities. And, since times have changed, the whole notion

            than closer-in suburbs or nearby rural counties.
        </p>
        <p>With its prefix ex-, (&ldquo;outside of,&rdquo; the noun exurb was coined around 1955 to
            describe the ring of well-off communities beyond the suburbs that were
            becoming commuter towns for an urban area. Most exurbs were probably
            quiet little towns before being discovered by young city dwellers with good
            incomes looking for a pleasant place to raise their children. Planners,
            advertisers, and political strategists today often talk about such topics as

            frequent service than an ordinary railway. Interurban transit today may

            Urbanization is often seen as a negative trend, with bad effects on quality of
            life and the environment. But apartments require much less heat than houses,
            and commuting by mass transit rather than cars can reduce pollution and

            America, where it has acquired a soft texture, a white interior, and fillers like
            eggs and peanut butter.
        </p>
        <p>Whenever people come in close contact with a population that's more
            powerful, they're generally forced to acculturate in order to survive. Learning
            a new language is usually part of the acculturation process, which may also
            include adopting new clothing, a new diet, new occupations, and even a new
            religion. An older generation often fails to acculturate thoroughly, but their
            children often pick up the new ways quickly.</p>

        <p>cross-cultural Dealing with or offering comparison
            between two or more different cultures or cultural areas.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; A cross-cultural study of 49 tribes revealed a tight relationship between the
            closeness of mother-infant bonding in a given tribe and that tribe's
            peacefulness toward its neighbors.
        </p>
        <p>If you've ever traveled in a foreign country, you've found yourself making
            some cross-cultural comparisons: Why are huge family dinners so much
            more common in Italy than back home? Why do Mexican teenagers seem to
            play with their little relatives so much more than teenagers in the U.S.?
            Cross-cultural analysis has produced extremely interesting data about such
            things as the effects of various nations' diets on their populations' health.
            Though cross-cultural was originally used by anthropologists to refer to
            research comparing aspects of different cultures, it's also often used to
            describe the reality that lots of us face daily while simply walking the streets
            of a big American city.</p>

        <p>&bull; He considered majoring in botany, but has decided instead on horticulture,
            hoping he can spend more time in a greenhouse than in the library or the lab.
        </p>
        <p>Hortus is Latin for &ldquo;garden,&rdquo; and the first gardens were planted about 10,000
            years ago in what is often called the Fertile Crescent&mdash;the crescent-shaped
            area stretching from Israel north through Syria and down Iraq's two great
            rivers to the Persian Gulf. Probably more fertile in previous centuries than it
            is today, it was the original home of such food plants as wheat, barley, peas,
            and lentils or their ancient ancestors (not to mention the ancestors of cows,
            pigs, sheep, and goats as well). Many horticulturists today work as
            researchers or plant breeders or tend orchards and greenhouses&mdash;but most
            American households contain at least one amateur horticulturist.</p>

        <p>&bull; Members of the emo subculture at her high school recognized each other by
            their skinny jeans, dyed hair, and canvas sneakers.

        <p>This common meaning of subculture (it has an older biological meaning)
            only appeared in the 1930s, and for about 20 years it was used mostly by
            sociologists, psychologists, and anthropologists. But in the 1950s, as
            America's wealth led to more and more teenagers getting their own cars and
            thus their independence, not to mention the arrival of rock 'n' roll, people
            noticed something unusual happening among young people, and began to
            speak of the &ldquo;youth subculture.&rdquo; As the country's wealth and freedom of
            movement continued to increase, we realized that the U.S. had become home
            to a large number of subcultures. Today the Web makes possible more than
            anyone could have dreamed of back in the 1950s. When we happen to
            stumble on a subculture&mdash;bodybuilders, Trekkies, hackers, Airstreamers,
            anime lovers, motocross enthusiasts&mdash;we may realize with astonishment that
            we had never even imagined that it might exist.</p>

        <p>DEM/DEMO comes from the Greek word meaning &ldquo;people.&rdquo; &ldquo;Government
            by the people&rdquo; was invented by the ancient Greeks, so it's appropriate that

        <p>demographic Having to do with the study of human

        <p>&bull; Each year the state government uses the most current demographic figures
            to determine how to distribute its funding for education.

        <p>Demographic analysis, the statistical description of human populations, is a
            tool used by government agencies, political parties, and manufacturers of
            consumer goods. Polls conducted on every topic imaginable, from age to
            toothpaste preference, give the government and corporations an idea of who
            the public is and what it needs and wants. The government's census, which is
            conducted every ten years, is the largest demographic survey of all. Today
            demographic is also being used as a noun; so, for example, TV advertisers
            are constantly worrying about how to appeal to &ldquo;the 18-to-24-year-old

        <p>&bull; Malaria remains endemic in tropical regions around the world.
        </p>
        <p>With its en- prefix, endemic means literally &ldquo;in the population.&rdquo; Since the
            panda is found in the wild exclusively in central China and eastern Tibet,
            scientists say it's &ldquo;endemic to&rdquo; those areas. But the word can also mean
            simply &ldquo;common&rdquo; or &ldquo;typical&rdquo;; so we can say that corruption is endemic in
            the government of a country, that colds are &ldquo;endemic in&rdquo; nursery school, or
            that love of Barbie dolls is &ldquo;endemic among&rdquo; young American girls. Don't
            confuse endemic with epidemic; something can be endemic in a region for

        <p>demagogue A political leader who appeals to the emotions

            her own political purposes.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; His supporters called him a &ldquo;man of the people&rdquo;; his enemies called him a
            lying demagogue.

        <p>Demagogue was once defined by the writer H. L. Mencken as &ldquo;one who will
            preach doctrines he knows to be untrue to men he knows to be idiots,&rdquo; and
            Mencken's definition still works quite well. The &ldquo;doctrines&rdquo; (ideas) preached
            by demagogues will naturally always be the kind that appeal directly to the
            ordinary voter, the &ldquo;common man&rdquo; or &ldquo;little guy.&rdquo; Appealing to the common
            people is not itself a bad thing, but it has often been used by those who
            calculate that demagoguery (or demagogy) is the easiest way to power. In
            most countries, fear of demagogic leaders is so strong that voters aren't even
            permitted to vote directly for the nation's leader, but instead vote only for a
            local representative.</p>

        <p>demotic Popular or common.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Partly because of television, the demotic language and accents of America's
            various regions have become more and more similar.
        </p>
        <p>For many years demotic was used only to describe the writing of ancient
            Egypt, as the name of the script used by ordinary Egyptians rather than by
            their priests. Demotic is still an intellectual word, but it can now be used to
            describe any popular style in contrast to a style associated with a higher class,
            especially a style of speech or writing. So, for example, demotic Californian
            is different from demotic Texan. The most demotic dress today is probably
            blue jeans and sneakers, and those who wear them have demotic taste in
            fashion. The problem is, in American society it can sometimes be hard to find
            a style that can't be described as demotic.</p>

        <p>&bull; He knew he would have to campaign as a populist in order to appeal to the

        </p>
        <p>The word populist first appeared in the 1890s with the founding of the
            Populist Party, which stood for the interests of the farmers against the big-
            money interests. In later years populism came to be associated with the blue-
            collar class in the cities as well. Populism can be hard to predict. It sometimes
            has a religious tendency; it usually isn't very interested in international
            affairs; it has sometimes been unfriendly to immigrants and blacks; and it's
            often anti-intellectual. So populism often switches between liberal and
            conservative. But the populist style always shows its concern with Americans
            with average incomes as opposed to the rich and powerful.</p>

            through the Great Depression. We often hear about what &ldquo;the general

            when Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s arrived there in 1519. But by the time Cort&eacute;s conquered
            the city in 1521 it wasn't nearly so populous, since European diseases had

            immaturity can all earn someone (usually a man) this description. If you call
            him this to his face, however, he might behave even worse.</p>

        <p>bovine (1) Relating to cows and oxen. (2) Placid, dull,
            unemotional.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In that part of Texas, many of the veterinarians specialize in bovine
            conditions and won't even deal with dogs or cats.
        </p>
        <p>Bovine comes from the Latin word for &ldquo;cow,&rdquo; though the biological family
            called the Bovidae actually includes not only cows and oxen but also goats,
            sheep, bison, and buffalo. So bovine is often used technically, when
            discussing &ldquo;bovine diseases,&rdquo; &ldquo;bovine anatomy,&rdquo; and so on. It can also
            describe a human personality, though it can be a rather unkind way to
            describe someone. When Hera, the wife of Zeus, is called &ldquo;cow-eyed,&rdquo;
            though, it's definitely a compliment, and Zeus fairly melts when she turns
            those big bovine eyes on him.</p>

        <p>canine Relating to dogs or the dog family; doglike.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Pleasure in getting their tummies rubbed must be a basic canine trait, since
            all our dogs have loved it.
        </p>
        <p>Dogs are prized for their talents and intelligence but aren't always given
            credit for their independence. Instead, tales of canine devotion and
            attachment are legendary; the old Lassie and Rin-Tin-Tin television series
            featured at least one heroic act of devotion per show. So we often hear people
            described as having &ldquo;doglike devotion&rdquo; or &ldquo;doglike loyalty.&rdquo; But canine
            itself, unlike doglike, usually refers to four-legged creatures. Canine is not
            only an adjective but also a noun. Dogs and their relatives in the Canidae
            family&mdash;the wolves, jackals, foxes, and coyotes&mdash;are often called canines.

        <p>feline (1) Relating to cats or the cat family. (2) Like a cat in being

        <p>&bull; The performers moved across the high wire with feline grace and agility.
        </p>
        <p>Cats have always provoked a strong reaction from humans. The Egyptians
            worshipped them, leaving thousands of feline mummies and idols as
            evidence. In the Middle Ages, felines were feared as agents of the devil, and
            were thought to creep around silently at night doing evil. (Notice that feline is
            also a noun.) The fascinating family called the Felidae includes about 40
            species of superb hunters, including the lions, tigers, jaguars, cheetahs,
            cougars, bobcats, and lynxes, and almost all of them are smooth, silent, and
            independent.</p>

        <p>&bull; As he conducted, Leonard Bernstein would fling his leonine mane wildly
            about.
        </p>
        <p>The Latin word for &ldquo;lion&rdquo; is leon, so the names Leon, Leo, and Leona all
            mean &ldquo;lion&rdquo; as well. A leonine head usually has magnificent hair, like a male
            lion's mane. The leonine strength of Heracles (Hercules) is symbolized by the
            lion's pelt that he wears, the pelt of the fabled Nemean Lion which he had
            slain as one of his Twelve Labors. But leonine courage is what is so notably
            lacking in The Wizard of Oz's Cowardly Lion.</p>

        <p>&bull; She describes her landlord's shape as porcine, and claims he has manners to
            match.
        </p>
        <p>Pigs are rarely given credit for their high intelligence or their friendliness as
            pets, but instead are mocked for their habit of cooling themselves in mud
            puddles and the aggressive way they often go after food. While porcine isn't
            as negative a term as swinish, it may describe things that are fat, greedy,
            pushy, or generally piggish&mdash;but primarily fat. Porky Pig and Miss Piggy
            aren't particularly porcine in their behavior, only in their appearance&mdash;that is,
            pink and pudgy.</p>

        <p>Foxes may be sleek and graceful runners with beautiful coats and tails, but
            they're almost impossible to keep out of the henhouse. Over the centuries
            they have &ldquo;outfoxed&rdquo; countless farmers. Because of the quick intelligence in
            their faces and their cunning nighttime raids, vulpine today almost always
            describes a face or manner that suggests a person capable of the same kind of
            sly scheming.</p>

        <p>CORD from the Latin word for &ldquo;heart,&rdquo; turns up in several common English

        <p>A new federal law may accord with&mdash;or be in accordance with&mdash;the

            hero Beowulf accords with Norse ideals of the early Middle Ages; but such
            behavior wouldn't have been in accordance with the ideals of a later young
            lord from the same general region, Shakespeare's Prince Hamlet. Accord is
            also a noun, meaning &ldquo;agreement.&rdquo; Thus, we often hear of two countries
            signing a peace accord; and we also frequently hear of two things or people
            being &ldquo;in accord with&rdquo; each other.</p>

        <p>&bull; In 1801 Napoleon signed a concord with the pope reestablishing the

        </p>
        <p>The roots of concord suggest the meaning &ldquo;hearts together.&rdquo; At the very
            outset of the American Revolution, the town of Concord, Massachusetts, was
            the site of a famous battle&mdash;obviously not exactly in keeping with its name. It
            shares that name with the capital of New Hampshire and a few other towns
            and cities, and Concordia, the original Latin word for &ldquo;concord,&rdquo; is the name
            of several Lutheran universities. Today concord is a rather formal term,
            probably most often used to mean a specific agreement; thus, two countries
            may sign a concord on matters that have led to trouble in the past.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Anything that is cordial comes from the heart. Cordial greetings to friends on
            the street, or cordial relations between two countries, are warm without being
            passionate. Cordial is also a noun, which originally meant any stimulating
            medicine or drink that was thought to be good for the heart. Today a cordial
            is a liqueur, a sweetened alcoholic drink with interesting flavoring. Cordials
            such as cr&egrave;me de menthe, Drambuie, or Benedictine are alcoholic enough to

            claimed the president was only interested in taking away our guns.
        </p>
        <p>Discord, a word more common in earlier centuries than today, means
            basically &ldquo;conflict,&rdquo; so discordant often means &ldquo;conflicting.&rdquo; The opinions of
            Supreme Court justices are frequently discordant; justices who disagree with
            the Court's decision usually write a dissenting opinion. Discordant is often
            used with a somewhat musical meaning, suggesting that a single wrong note
            or harmony has been heard in the middle of a performance&mdash;even though
            musical words such as chord actually come from a different Latin word,
            meaning &ldquo;cord&rdquo; or &ldquo;string&rdquo; (a reference to the strings of ancient instruments

        <p>CULP comes from the Latin word for &ldquo;guilt.&rdquo; Its best-known appearance in

        <p>culpable Deserving to be condemned or blamed.

        </p>
        <p>Culpable normally means simply &ldquo;guilty.&rdquo; To a lawyer, &ldquo;culpable
            negligence&rdquo; is carelessness so serious that it becomes a crime&mdash;for instance,
            building a swimming pool in your suburban yard with no fence around it, so
            that a neighbor's child could fall in and drown. But degrees of culpability are
            important in the law; someone who intended to do harm always faces a more
            serious challenge in court than someone who was merely careless.</p>

            exculpated by witnesses and won't be facing criminal charges.

        <p>Exculpate gets its meaning from the prefix ex-, which here means &ldquo;out of&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;away from.&rdquo; A suspected murderer may be exculpated by the confession of
            another person. And exculpatory evidence is the kind that defense lawyers

        <p>&bull; It was his own father who finally inculpated him, though without intending
            to.
        </p>
        <p>Inculpate is the opposite of exculpate, just as inculpatory evidence is the
            opposite of exculpatory evidence. By inculpating someone else, an accused
            person may manage to exculpate himself. Through plea bargaining, the
            prosecution can often encourage a defendant to inculpate his friends in return
            for a lighter sentence.</p>

            parents were satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>Mea culpa, Latin for &ldquo;through my fault,&rdquo; comes from the prayer in the
            Catholic mass in which, back when Latin was still the language of the mass,
            one would confess to having sinned &ldquo;mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima
            culpa&rdquo; (&ldquo;through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous
            fault&rdquo;). When we say &ldquo;Mea culpa&rdquo; today, it means &ldquo;I apologize&rdquo; or &ldquo;It
            was
            my fault.&rdquo; But mea culpa is also common as a noun. So, for instance, a book
            may be a long mea culpa for the author's past treatment of women, or an oil
            company may issue a mea culpa after a tanker runs aground.</p>

        <p>DICT comes from dicere, the Latin word meaning &ldquo;to speak.&rdquo; So a
            dictionary is a treasury of words for speaking. And a contradiction (with its

        <p>When your English teacher complains about some of the words you chose to
            use in an essay, she's talking about your diction. She may also use the term
            when commenting on the word choices made by a poet, and why a particular
            word was the best one possible in a particular line. (Compare syntax.) But the
            second meaning of diction is just as common, and your English teacher might
            use that one on you as well, especially when she's asked you to read

        </p>
        <p>&bull; In 1989 an edict by the leader of Iran pronouncing a death sentence on a
            British novelist stunned the world.
        </p>
        <p>Edicts are few and far between in a democracy, since very few important
            laws can be made by a president or prime minister acting alone. But when a
            crisis arose in the Roman Republic, the senate would appoint a dictator, who
            would have the power to rule by edict. The idea was that the dictator could
            make decisions quickly, issuing his edicts faster than the senate could act.
            When the crisis was over, the edicts were canceled and the dictator usually
            retired from public life. Things are different today: dictators almost always
            install themselves in power, and they never give it up.</p>

        <p>Questions of jurisdiction are generally technical legal matters. The most

            technicalities, jurisdictional matters sometimes turn out to be all-important in
            the final outcome. Jurisdiction may depend on where you are (for example, in
            which state), on who you are (if you're a juvenile, for example, you may only
            be tried in juvenile court), and on what the subject is (for example, cases

        </p>
        <p>The word dictum is frequently used in philosophy, but also in economics,

            written opinion an obiter dictum, or &ldquo;statement made in passing&rdquo;&mdash;a strong
            statement that isn't directly relevant to the case being decided. If they're well
            thought out and eloquent, obiter dicta (notice the plural form) may be

        </p>
        <p>The words agnostic and agnosticism were coined around 1870 by the great
            English biologist T. H. Huxley, who had just spent a decade defending the
            works of Charles Darwin against the attacks of the church. Scientists often
            put a high value on evidence when arguing about religion, and many agnostic
            thinkers believe that human minds simply aren't equipped to grasp the nature
            of God. But agnostics differ from atheists, who actually claim that no God
            exists and may even think they can prove it. You may have seen the similar
            word gnostic, the name for followers of certain religious sects from around
            the time of Christ that sought spiritual knowledge and rejected the material
            world. An increasing interest in gnosticism today can be seen in the popular
            novels of Philip Pullman, Dan Brown, and Neil Gaiman.</p>

            was originally a strictly medical term, but it soon broadened to include
            predictions made by experts of all kinds. Thus, for example, economists are
            constantly offering prognoses (notice the irregular plural form) about where
            the economy is going, and climate scientists regularly prognosticate about
            how quickly the earth's atmosphere is warming.</p>

        <p>GRAPH comes from the Greek verb graphein, &ldquo;to write.&rdquo; Thus, a biography
            is a written account of someone's life (see BIO), a discography is a written
            list of recordings on disc (records or CDs), and a filmography is a list of
            motion pictures. But lots of uses of -graph and -graphy don't mean literally
            &ldquo;writing&rdquo; (as in autograph or paragraph), but instead something more like
            &ldquo;recording,&rdquo; as in photography, seismograph, or graph itself.</p>

            many cultures, including Indian, Persian, and Islamic cultures; Arabic puts a
            particularly high value on beautiful script, and in East Asia calligraphy has
            long been considered a major art. Calligraphers in the West use pens with
            wide nibs, with which they produce strokes of widely differing width within a

            small-minded or improper in his entire life.
        </p>
        <p>For those able to read, reading stories of the lives of the saints was a popular
            pastime for centuries, and books collecting short saints' biographies were best
            sellers. These often included terrifically colorful stories (about slaying
            dragons, magically traveling through space, etc.) that were perhaps a bit too
            good to be strictly true, and after finding God not one of them ever did a

            in France. The choreographer of a major ballet, which might run to an hour

        <p>lithograph A picture made by printing from a flat surface

        <p>Lithos is Greek for &ldquo;stone,&rdquo; and a stone surface has traditionally been

            method of printing books and newspapers. Artists use lithography to produce
            prints (works intended to be sold in many copies), and art lithographs
            sometimes resemble older types of prints, including etchings, engravings, and
            woodcuts. Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Joan Mir&oacute;, and M. C. Escher are
            among the many artists who have used lithography to produce important

        <p>A writer may produce an artful piece of prose, one that's clearly and elegantly
            written. The same writer might also make an artful argument, one that
            cleverly leaves out certain details and plays up others so as to make a
            stronger case. In the first instance, the prose is well crafted; in the second, the
            argument might instead be called crafty. But even though both uses are

            it's sometimes seen in descriptions of craftsmanship (&ldquo;The artifice that went
            into this jewelry can still astound us,&rdquo; &ldquo;The chef had used all his artifice to
            disguise the nature of the meat&rdquo;). But it can also be used for many situations
            that don't involve physical materials (&ldquo;They had gotten around the rules by a
            clever artifice,&rdquo; &ldquo;The artifice of the plot is ingenious&rdquo;). Like its adjective,
            artificial, artifice isn't necessarily either positive nor negative. But both
            words can make us slightly uncomfortable if we like to think of simplicity
            and naturalness as important values.</p>

        <p>artisan A skilled worker or craftsperson.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; At the fair, they saw examples of the best carving, pottery, and jewelry by
            local artisans.
        </p>
        <p>Artisans aren't the same as artists, but it can sometimes be hard to tell the
            difference. In the Middle Ages, artisans organized themselves into guilds. In
            every city each group of artisans&mdash;weavers, carpenters, shoemakers, and so
            on&mdash;had its own guild, which set wages and prices, kept standards high, and
            protected its members from outside competitors. In America, however, most
            artisans have always been fiercely independent. Today, when factories
            produce almost all of our goods, artisans usually make only fine objects for
            those who can afford them. And we now even include food among the
            artisan's crafts, so you can buy artisanal cheeses, breads, and chocolates&mdash;but
            probably not if you're watching your budget.</p>

        <p>FORT comes from fortis, Latin for &ldquo;strong.&rdquo; The familiar noun fort, meaning
            a building strengthened against possible attacks, comes directly from it. And

        <p>Medieval cities were fortified against attack by high walls, and volunteers
            may fortify a levee against an overflowing river by means of sandbags. Foods
            can be fortified by adding vitamins, but &ldquo;fortified wines,&rdquo; such as sherry and
            port, have brandy (a &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; drink) rather than vitamins added to them. By
            adopting good exercise habits, you can fortify your body against illness. And
            fortifying needn't always be physical. An author's reputation may be fortified

        <p>&bull; The city's fortifications had withstood powerful assaults by catapults,
            battering rams, and tall siege towers that rolled up to release soldiers onto the
            top of the walls.
        </p>
        <p>In the Middle Ages, many European cities were entirely enclosed by sturdy
            walls, with walkways along the top and towers at intervals, designed to make
            an invasion impossible. A water-filled ditch, or moat, might run alongside the
            wall for added defense. Such defenses turned the entire city into a fort, or
            fortress. Over the centuries, fortifications changed steadily with the
            development of new weaponry. In World War II, the German fortification of
            the French coast included antitank barriers, bunkers, minefields, and
            underwater obstacles, but it wasn't enough to turn back the immense force of
            the Allied invasion on D-day.</p>

            a special strength. But no one can agree on how to pronounce it: all three

            firmness and steadiness of will, or &ldquo;backbone.&rdquo; The philosopher Plato long

        <p>Many students think that adding unnecessary sentences with long words will

            concision, since concise writing is usually easier to read, better thought out,
            and better organized&mdash;that is, simply better writing. Words such as short
            don't have the full meaning of concise, which usually means not just &ldquo;brief&rdquo;

        <p>Excise takes part of its meaning from the prefix ex-, &ldquo;out.&rdquo; A writer may
            excise long passages of a novel to reduce it to a reasonable length, or a film
            director may excise a scene that might give offense. A surgeon may excise a
            large cancerous tumor, or make a tiny excision to examine an organ's tissue.
            Excise is also a noun, meaning a tax paid on something manufactured and
            sold in the U.S. Much of what consumers pay for tobacco or alcohol products
            go to cover the excise taxes that the state and federal government charge the
            manufacturers. But it's only accidental that this noun is spelled like the verb,
            since it comes from a completely different source.</p>

            &mdash;that is, how good it is at giving the same result every time it measures the

        <p>apiary A place where bees are kept for their honey.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Apple orchards are excellent sites for apiaries, since the bees keep the apple
            trees productive by pollinating them.
        </p>
        <p>Beekeeping, or apiculture, is the care of honeybees that ensures that they
            produce more honey than they can use. An apiary usually consists of many
            separate beehives. The social life of a hive is strange and marvelous. The
            queen bee, who will become the mother of an entire colony, is actually
            created by being fed &ldquo;royal jelly&rdquo; while she is still only a larva. The tens of
            thousands of worker bees are underdeveloped females; only a handful of the
            bees are male, and they do no work at all. The workers defend the hive by
            kamikaze means, stinging any intruder and dying as they do so. There's more
            drama in a quiet-looking apiary than the casual observer might notice.</p>

            a backward kick done in midair by a trained horse. Capricorn, meaning
            &ldquo;horned goat,&rdquo; is a constellation and one of the signs of the zodiac. And a

            acrobatic feats atop prancing horses, were her favorites.
        </p>
        <p>Equestrian comes from equus, Latin for &ldquo;horse.&rdquo; Old statues of military
            heroes, like the famous one of General Sherman on New York's Fifth
            Avenue, are frequently equestrian. In these sculptures the man always sits
            nobly upright on a horse, but the horse's stance varies; depending on whether
            the rider was killed in battle or survived, was victorious or defeated, the horse
            traditionally stands with four, three, or two hooves on the ground. Equestrian
            statues have been popular through the centuries, because until the 20th
            century almost every officer in Europe and America was trained in equestrian
            skills and combat.</p>

            biting, and walked with his knees bent in a kind of crouch.
        </p>
        <p>Lupine comes from lupus, Latin for &ldquo;wolf,&rdquo; and its related adjective lupinus,
            &ldquo;wolfish.&rdquo; Lupine groups have a highly organized social structure, with
            leaders and followers clearly distinguished; dogs, since they're descended
            from wolves, often show these lupine patterns when living in groups. Stories
            of children raised by wolves (the most famous being Romulus, the legendary
            founder of Rome) have generally been hard to prove, partly because &ldquo;wild&rdquo;
            children lack human language abilities and can't describe their experiences.
            Lupine is also a noun, the name of a well-known garden flower, which was

        </p>
        <p>Sheep belong to the same family of mammals as goats, antelope, bison,
            buffalo, and cows. The genus Ovis includes at least five species, including the
            domestic sheep. Some 12,000 years ago, in the area now known as Iraq,
            sheep became one of the first animals to be domesticated; only the dog is
            known to have been tamed earlier. At first, they were valued for their milk,
            skin, and meat (mutton and lamb); not until about 1500 B.C. did the weaving
            of wool begin. Today a billion sheep are being farmed worldwide. The term
            ovine (which is a noun as well as an adjective) is mostly used in scientific and
            medical writing&mdash;which means you could impress your friends by dropping it

            extraordinarily popular pastime in America, where over 40 million people
            pursue it. Roger Tory Peterson's many field guides have long been some of
            the amateur ornithologist's most useful tools. Amateurs often make essential
            contributions to serious ornithology, as in the annual Christmas Bird Count,
            when tens of thousands of birders fan out across North and South America to
            produce a kind of census of all the species in the New World.</p>

        <p>serpentine Like a snake or serpent in shape or movement;
            winding.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The Great Wall of China, the greatest construction of all time, wends its
            serpentine way for some 4,000 miles across the Chinese landscape.
        </p>
        <p>A snake moves by curving and winding along the ground. Roads through the
            Pyrenees, the mountains that separate Spain from France, tend to be
            serpentine, curving back and forth on themselves up and down the steep
            slopes. Serpentine has other meanings as well. As a noun, it's the name for a
            soft green mineral, and also for the party streamers you might throw at
            midnight on New Year's Eve. The serpentine belt under the hood in your car
            is the long, looping belt that most of the car's accessories&mdash;the AC, the power
            steering, the alternator, and so on&mdash;depend on to get their power.</p>

        <p>simian Having to do with monkeys or apes; monkeylike.

        <p>&bull; Every afternoon the pale youth could be found watching the simian antics in
            the Monkey House with strange intensity.
        </p>
        <p>The Latin word for &ldquo;ape&rdquo; is simia, which itself comes from simus, &ldquo;snub-
            nosed.&rdquo; Simian is usually a scientific word; thus, for instance, biologists
            study simian viruses in the search for cures to AIDS and other diseases. But
            simian can be used by the rest of us to describe human behavior. Human
            babies often cling to their mothers in a simian way, and kids playing on a
            jungle gym may look like simians. But if you notice that a friend has a simian
            style of walking or eating bananas, it might be best not to tell him.</p>

        <p>CRYPT comes from the Greek word for &ldquo;hidden.&rdquo; To encrypt a message is
            to encode it&mdash;that is, to hide its meaning in code language. When a scientific
            term begins with crypto-, it always means that there's something hidden about
            it .</p>
        <p />
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <p />
        <p>crypt (1) A room completely or partly underground, especially under
            the main floor of a church. (2) A room or area in a large aboveground tomb.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; His old nightmare was of being locked in a crypt with corpses as his only
            companions.
        </p>
        <p>Hidden under the main floor of a great church is often a large room, often
            with a tomb as its centerpiece. Many major European churches were built
            over the remains of a saint&mdash;the Vatican's great St. Peter's Basilica is an
            example&mdash;and instead of having the coffin buried, it was often given its
            spacious room below ground level. In a large aboveground tomb, or
            mausoleum, there may be several small chambers for individual coffins, also
            called crypts; when the comic book Tales from the Crypt made its first
            appearance in 1950, it was this meaning that the authors were referring to.</p>

        <p />
        <p>encrypt (1) To convert into cipher. (2) To convert a message into
            code.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Messages on the group's Web site are encrypted in code words to keep law-
            enforcement agents from understanding them.
        </p>
        <p>Codes aren't always in another language; people have always been able to
            communicate in ways that conceal their real meaning. In countries ruled by
            dictators, novelists and playwrights have sometimes managed to encrypt their
            messages, conveying political ideas to their audiences so that the authorities
            never notice. But encryption today usually refers to a complex procedure
            performed on electronic text to make sure the wrong people&mdash;whether a
            nation's enemies or a business competitor (most businesses use encryption
            today)&mdash;can't read it. And sensitive data that merely resides on a company's
            own computers is often encrypted as well.</p>
        <p />

        <p>cryptic (1) Mysterious; puzzlingly short. (2) Acting to hide or
            conceal.

        <p>&bull; From across the room, Louisa threw Philip a cryptic look, and he puzzled
            over what she was trying to tell him.
        </p>
        <p>Until the writing on the famous Rosetta Stone was finally translated in the
            early 19th century, Egyptian hieroglyphic writing was entirely cryptic, its
            meaning hidden from the modern world. In the same way, a cryptic comment
            is one whose meaning is unclear, and a cryptic note may leave you
            wondering. Cryptic coloring among plants and animals acts like camouflage;
            so, for example, some moths that are tasty to blue jays are cryptically colored
            to look like bugs that jays won't touch.</p>

        <p>&bull; As a graduate student in mathematics, she never dreamed she would end up
            working in cryptography for the Defense Department.
        </p>
        <p>During World War II, cryptography became an extremely complex science
            for both the Allied and Axis powers. The Allies managed to secretly crack
            the code produced by the Nazis' Enigma machine, and thereby may have
            shortened the war by two years. The Axis cryptographers, on the other hand,
            never managed to crack the Americans' ultimate code&mdash;the spoken languages
            of the Navajo and other American Indians. In the age of computers,
            cryptography has become almost unbelievably complex; it's widely used in
            peacetime in such areas as banking telecommunications.</p>

        <p>AB/ABS comes to us from Latin, and means &ldquo;from,&rdquo; &ldquo;away,&rdquo; or &ldquo;off.&rdquo; Abuse
            is the use of something in the wrong way. To abduct is to &ldquo;lead away from&rdquo;
            or kidnap. Aberrant behavior is behavior that &ldquo;wanders away from&rdquo; what is
            acceptable. But there are so many words that include these roots that it would
            be absurd to try to list them all here.</p>

        <p>Wagner's massive four-part opera The Ring of the Nibelung begins with a
            dwarf absconding with gold which he turns into a magic ring. And in J. R. R.
            Tolkien's The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins absconds from Gollum's caves with the
            ring he has found, the ring Gollum calls &ldquo;my precious&rdquo;; what follows is
            detailed in the three-volume Lord of the Rings. (Tolkien knew Wagner's
            opera well.) A young couple might abscond from their parents to get married,
            but sooner or later they must face those parents again.</p>

        <p>&bull; Her parents had left her two million dollars when they died, having been so
            abstemious for years that their neighbors all assumed they were poor.
        </p>
        <p>Many 14th-century monks lived by the Rule of St. Benedict, which demands
            an abstemious life of obedience and poverty. But not all monks could
            maintain such abstemious habits. Chaucer's Canterbury Tales contains a
            portrait of a fat monk who is supposed to follow a vegetarian diet but instead
            is an enthusiastic hunter who loves a juicy swan best. He justifies breaking
            the Rule by saying that it's old-fashioned and that he's just keeping up with
            modern times. Abstemious itself has a slightly old-fashioned sound today,
            especially in a country where everyone is constantly encouraged to consume.</p>

        <p>abstraction The consideration of a thing or idea without
            associating it with a particular example.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; All the ideas she came up with in class were abstractions, since she had no
            experience of actual nursing at all.
        </p>
        <p>From its roots, abstraction should mean basically &ldquo;something pulled or
            drawn away.&rdquo; So abstract art is art that has moved away from painting
            objects of the ordinary physical world in order to show something beyond it.
            Theories are often abstractions; so a theory about economics, for instance,
            may &ldquo;pull back&rdquo; to take a broad view that somehow explains all of economics
            (but maybe doesn't end up explaining any of it very successfully). An
            abstract of a medical or scientific article is a one-paragraph summary of its
            contents&mdash;that is, the basic findings &ldquo;pulled out&rdquo; of the article.</p>

        <p>&bull; In every class he fills the blackboard with abstruse calculations, and we
            usually leave more confused than ever.
        </p>
        <p>The original meaning of abstruse, coming almost straight from the Latin, was
            &ldquo;concealed, hidden.&rdquo; It's easy to see how the word soon came to describe the
            kind of language used by those who possess certain kinds of expert
            knowledge (and don't necessarily want to share it with other people).
            Scientific writing is often filled with the kind of abstruse special vocabulary
            that's necessary for exact and precise descriptions. Unfortunately, the
            language of a science like quantum physics can make an already difficult
            subject even more abstruse to the average person.</p>

        <p>PED- comes from the Greek word for &ldquo;child.&rdquo; The same root also has the

            school. In time, pedagogue came to mean simply &ldquo;teacher&rdquo;; today the word
            has an old-fashioned ring to it, so it often means a stuffy, boring teacher. The
            word pedagogy, though, is still widely used, and often means simply
            &ldquo;teaching.&rdquo; And pedagogic training is what everyone majoring in education
            receives.</p>

        <p>Since iatros means &ldquo;physician&rdquo; in Greek (see IATR), words such as pediatric

            the same medical treatment, only milder. Benjamin Spock was the most
            famous pediatrician of the 20th century, and his book Baby and Child Care
            changed the way millions of Americans raised their children.</p>

        <p>tropism Automatic movement by an organism unable to move

            toward or away from a stimulus.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The new president was soon showing a tropism for bold action, a tendency
            that seemed more the result of instinct than of careful thought.
        </p>
        <p>In hydrotropism, a plant's roots grow in the direction of increasing moisture,
            hoping to obtain water. In phototropism, a plant (or fungus) moves toward
            light, usually the sun&mdash;perhaps because, in the colder climates where such
            plants are usually found, concentrating the sun's warmth within the sun-
            seeking flower can create a warm and inviting environment for the insects
            that fertilize it. In thigmotropism, the organism moves in response to being
            touched; most climbing plants, for example, put out tiny tendrils that feel
            around for something solid and then attach themselves or curl around it.
            When microbiologists talk about tropism, however, they're often referring
            instead to the way a virus will seek out a particular type of cell to infect. And
            when intellectuals use the word, they usually mean a tendency shown by a
            person or group which they themselves might not even be aware of.</p>

        <p>&bull; The apartment had been reduced to an advanced state of entropy, as if a tiny

            together in a crazy soup.

        <p>With its Greek prefix en-, meaning &ldquo;within,&rdquo; and the trop- root here meaning
            &ldquo;change,&rdquo; entropy basically means &ldquo;change within (a closed system).&rdquo; The
            closed system we usually think of when speaking of entropy (especially if
            we're not physicists) is the entire universe. But entropy applies to closed
            systems of any size. Entropy is seen when the ice in a glass of water in a
            warm room melts&mdash;that is, as the temperature of everything in the room
            evens out. In a slightly different type of entropy, a drop of food coloring in
            that glass of water soon spreads out evenly. However, when a nonphysicist
            uses the word, he or she is usually trying to describe a large-scale collapse.</p>

            the best-known species, garden heliotrope, is a popular and fragrant perennial
            that resembles the forget-me-not. The heliotrope tends to follow the sun&mdash;
            that is, turn its blossoms toward the sun as it travels from East to West every
            day. But the fact is, heliotropism&mdash;turning toward the sun&mdash;is common
            among flowers (and even leaves), and some, like the sunflower, are more
            dramatically heliotropic than the heliotrope. Those in the far North actually
            use their petals to reflect the sun's heat onto the flower's central ovary during
            the short growing season.</p>

        <p>psychotropic Acting on the mind.

        <p>&bull; My mother is taking two drugs that may produce psychotropic side effects,
            and I'm worried that they might be interacting.
        </p>
        <p>Psychotropic is used almost always to describe substances that we consume.
            Such substances are more numerous than you might think, and some have
            been known for thousands of years. Native American religions, for example,
            have used psychotropic substances derived from certain cactuses and
            mushrooms for centuries. Caffeine and nicotine can be called psychotropic.
            Psychotropic prescription drugs include antidepressants (such as Prozac) and
            tranquilizers (such as Valium). Any medication that blocks pain, from aspirin
            to the anesthetics used during surgery, can be considered a psychotropic drug.
            Even children are now prescribed psychotropic drugs, often to treat attention
            deficit disorder. And all recreational drugs are psychotropic. Psychoactive is
            a common synonym of psychotropic.</p>

        <p>NEO comes from the Greek neos, meaning &ldquo;new.&rdquo; Neo- has become a part of
            many English words. Some are easy to understand; for example, neo-Nazi.
            Some are less so; you might not immediately guess that neotropical means
            &ldquo;from the tropics of the New World,&rdquo; or that a neophyte is a &ldquo;newcomer.&rdquo;
            When William Ramsay discovered four new gases, he named them all using

            (&ldquo;idle&rdquo;), krypton (&ldquo;hidden&rdquo;), xenon (&ldquo;strange&rdquo;)&mdash;and neon

        <p>neoclassic Relating to a revival or adaptation of the styles of
            ancient Greece and Roman, especially in music, art, or architecture.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; He had always admired the paintings of the French neoclassical masters,
            especially Poussin and Ingres.
        </p>
        <p>In the arts and architecture, a style that has existed for a long time usually
            produces a reaction against it. So after the showy style of Europe's so-called
            baroque era (from about 1600 to the early 1700s), the reaction came in the
            form of the neoclassical movement, bringing order, restraint, and simpler and
            more conservative structures, whether in plays, sonatas, sculptures, or public
            buildings. Its inspiration was the art of ancient Greece and Rome&mdash;that is, of
            classical antiquity. Why classical? In Latin classicus meant &ldquo;of the highest
            class,&rdquo; so in English classic and classical originally described the best
            ancient Greek and Latin literature, but soon came to mean simply &ldquo;of ancient
            Greek and Rome,&rdquo; since these were already seen as the highest and best
            cultures. Neoclassic generally describes artworks from the 1700s or early
            1800s (by the painter David, the composer Mozart, the sculptor Canova, etc.),
            but also works from the 20th century that seem to have been inspired by the
            ideals of Greece and Rome.</p>

        <p>&bull; Around the Mediterranean, the Neolithic period was a time of trade, of
            stock breeding, and of the first use of pottery.
        </p>
        <p>Since lithos in Greek means &ldquo;stone,&rdquo; the Neolithic period is the &ldquo;new&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;late&rdquo; period of the Stone Age, in contrast to the Paleolithic period (&ldquo;old&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;early&rdquo; period&mdash;see PALEO) and the Mesolithic period (&ldquo;middle&rdquo; period) of
            the Stone Age. The use of polished stone tools came to different parts of the
            world at different times, but the Neolithic Age is usually said to begin around
            9000 B.C. and to end around 3000 B.C., when the Bronze Age begins. The
            Neolithic is the era when the farming of plants and animals begins, and when,

        <p>In the 1960s several well-known socialist intellectuals, including Norman
            Podhoretz and Irving Kristol, alarmed by growing political extremism on the
            left, began to move in the other direction. Soon the term neoconservative (or
            neocon for short) was being attached to them. Rather than simply drifting
            toward the political center, Podhoretz and Kristol actually moved far to the
            right, especially on the issue of maintaining a strong military stance toward
            the rest of the world. The main magazine of neoconservatism became
            Podhoretz's Commentary; it was later joined by the Weekly Standard, edited
            by Kristol's son William. Not everyone agrees on how to define these terms;

        <p>&bull; After exploding, a nova leaves a &ldquo;white dwarf&rdquo; which may explode again in
            the future, but a supernova destroys the entire star.
        </p>
        <p>A nova, despite its name, isn't actually a &ldquo;new&rdquo; star, but rather one that wasn't
            noticed until it exploded, when it may increase in brightness by a million
            times before returning to its previous state a few days later. A supernova is
            far larger; a star in its supernova state may emit a billion times as much light
            as previously. After a few weeks it begins to dim, until it eventually ceases to
            exist; it's often replaced by a black hole. (Though remains that were shot out
            into space may survive; those of a great supernova seen in A.D. 1054 are now
            known as the Crab Nebula.) All this may serve as a warning to those human
            stars whose fame explodes too rapidly; supernovas of this kind have
            sometimes vanished by the following year.</p>

        <p>&bull; After seeing her latest grades, her parents imposed new rules about how
            much time she had to spend on homework every night.
        </p>
        <p>The Latin imposui meant &ldquo;put upon,&rdquo; and that meaning carried over into
            English in impose. A CEO may impose a new manager on one of the
            company's plants. A state may impose new taxes on luxury items or
            cigarettes, and the federal government sometimes imposes trade restrictions
            on another country to punish it. A polite apology might begin with &ldquo;I hope
            I'm not imposing on you&rdquo; (that is, &ldquo;forcing my presence on you&rdquo;). And a self-

            you juxtapose them.
        </p>
        <p>Since juxta means &ldquo;near&rdquo; in Latin, it's easy to see how juxtapose was formed.
            Juxtaposing is generally done for examination or effect. Interior designers
            constantly make decisions about juxtaposing objects and colors for the best
            effect. Juxtaposing two video clips showing the different things that a
            politician said about the same subject at two different times can be an
            effective means of criticizing. The juxtaposition of two similar X-rays can
            help medical students distinguish between two conditions that may be hard to
            tell apart. And advertisements frequently juxtapose &ldquo;before&rdquo; and &ldquo;after&rdquo;

        <p>Though transposing two digits can be disastrous, transposing two letters in a

            Doctors sometimes discover that something in the body&mdash;a nerve, an organ,
            etc.&mdash;has been transposed, or moved away from its proper place. For

            scenes from a character's past onto scenes from the present. Superimposing
            your own ideas on something, such as a historical event, has to be done

        <p>Tenure is about holding on to something, almost always a job or position. So
            you can speak of someone's 30-year tenure as chairman, or someone's brief
            tenure in the sales manager's office. But tenure means something slightly
            different in the academic world. In American colleges and universities, the
            best (or luckiest) teachers have traditionally been granted a lifetime
            appointment known as tenure after about six years of teaching. Almost
            nobody has as secure a job as a tenured professor, but getting tenure can be
            difficult, and most of them have earned it.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Tenable means &ldquo;holdable.&rdquo; In the past it was often used in a physical sense&mdash;
            for example, to refer to a city that an army was trying to &ldquo;hold&rdquo; militarily
            against an enemy force. But nowadays it's almost always used when speaking
            of &ldquo;held&rdquo; ideas and theories. If you hold an opinion but evidence appears that
            completely contradicts it, your opinion is no longer tenable. So, for example,
            the old ideas that cancer is infectious or that being bled by leeches can cure
            your whooping cough now seem untenable.</p>

        <p>A tenet is something we hold, but not with our hands. Tenets are often ideals,

        <p>&bull; Monoculture is practiced on a vast scale in the American Midwest, where

        </p>
        <p>The Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49, which led to the deaths of over a million
            people, resulted from the monoculture of potatoes, which were destroyed by a
            terrible blight, leaving farmers nothing else to eat. Almost every traditional
            farming society has practiced crop rotation, the planting of different crops on
            a given piece of land from year to year, so as to keep the soil from losing its
            quality. But in the modern world, monoculture has become the rule on the
            largest commercial farms, where the same crop can be planted year after year
            by means of the intensive use of fertilizers. Modern monoculture has
            produced huge crops; on a large scale, it permits great efficiency in planting,
            pest control, and harvesting. But many experts believe this all comes at a

            the lone individual, any huge institution or government bureaucracy can seem
            monolithic. But the truth may be different: The former U.S.S.R. once seemed

        <p>monotheism The worship of a single god.

        <p>The monotheism of the ancient Hebrews had to combat the polytheism

            As the Bible relates, several times in their history the Hebrews turned away
            from their monotheistic beliefs and accepted foreign gods, such as those
            imported by King Solomon. Each time their own God would punish them for
            their disloyalty, and the people of Israel would return to monotheism. Today

        <p>Unicameral means &ldquo;one-chambered,&rdquo; and the term almost always describes a
            governing body. Our federal legislature, like those of most democracies, is
            bicameral, with two legislative (lawmaking) bodies&mdash;the Senate and the
            House of Representatives. And except for Nebraska, all the state legislatures
            are also bicameral. So why did the nation decide on a bicameral system?
            Partly in order to keep some power out of the hands of ordinary voters, who
            the Founding Fathers didn't completely trust. For that reason, the original
            Constitution states that senators are to be elected by the state legislatures; not
            until 1914, after passage of a Constitutional amendment, did we first cast
            direct votes for our senators.</p>

        <p>The world is a smaller place than it used to be, and we get uncomfortable
            when a single nation adopts a policy of unilateralism&mdash;that is, acting
            independently with little regard for what the rest of the world thinks. A
            unilateral invasion of another country, for instance, usually looks like a grab
            for power and resources. But occasionally the world welcomes a unilateral
            action, as when the U.S. announced unilateral nuclear-arms reductions in the
            early 1990s. Previously, such reductions had only happened as part of
            bilateral (&ldquo;two-sided&rdquo;) agreements with the old Soviet Union. Multilateral
            agreements, on issues such as climate change, often involve most of the
            world's nations.</p>

        <p>unison (1) Perfect agreement. (2) Sameness of musical pitch.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Unable to read music well enough to harmonize, the village choir sang only
            in unison.
        </p>
        <p>This word usually appears in the phrase &ldquo;in unison,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;together,
            at the same time&rdquo; or &ldquo;at the same musical pitch.&rdquo; So an excited crowd
            responding to a speaker may shout in unison, and a group of demonstrators
            may chant in unison. The old church music called Gregorian chant was
            written to be sung in unison, with no harmonizing voices, and kindergarten
            kids always sing in unison (at least when they can all find the same pitch). In
            a similar way, an aerobics class moves in unison following the instructor, and
            a group or even a whole town may work in unison when everyone agrees on a
            common goal.</p>

        <p>unitarian Relating or belonging to a religious group that
            believes that God exists only in one person and stresses individual freedom of
            belief.

        <p>&bull; With his unitarian tendencies, he wasn't likely to get into fights over
            religious beliefs.
        </p>
        <p>Unitarianism, originally a sect of Christianity believing in a single or unitary
            God, grew up in 18th-century England and developed in America in the early
            19th century. Though they believe in Christ's teaching, they reject the idea of
            the three-part Trinity&mdash;God as father, son, and holy spirit&mdash;and thus deny
            that Christ was divine, so some people don't consider them truly Christian. In
            this century the Unitarians joined with the Universalist Church, a movement
            founded on a belief in universal salvation&mdash;that is, the saving of every soul
            from damnation after death. Both have always been liberal and fairly small;
            today they count about half a million members. Without a capital letter,
            unitarian refers simply to belief in a unitary God, or in unity within some
            nonreligious system.</p>

        <p>TERM/TERMIN comes from the Latin verb terminare, &ldquo;to limit, bound, or
            set limits to,&rdquo; and the noun terminus, &ldquo;limit or boundary.&rdquo; In English, those
            boundaries or limits tend to be final. A term goes on for a given amount of
            time and then ends, and to terminate a sentence or a meeting or a ballgame
            means to end it.</p>

        <p>A terminal disease ends in death. If you're terminally bored, you're &ldquo;bored to
            death.&rdquo; For many students, a high-school diploma is their terminal degree
            (others finish college before terminating their education). A bus or train
            terminal is the endpoint of the line. A computer terminal was originally the
            endpoint of a line connecting to a central computer. A terminal ornament may
            mark the end of a building, and terminal punctuation ends this sentence.</p>

        <p>When you determine something, you decide on what it is, which means you
            put limits or boundaries on its identity. So something indeterminate lacks
            identifying limits. A mutt is usually the product of indeterminate breeding,
            since at least the father's identity is generally a mystery. A painting of
            indeterminate origins is normally less valued than one with the painter's name

        </p>
        <p>This word comes straight from Latin. In the Roman empire, a terminus was a
            boundary stone, and all boundary stones had a minor god associated with
            them, whose name was Terminus. Terminus was a kind of keeper of the
            peace, since wherever there was a terminus there could be no arguments
            about where your property ended and your neighbor's property began. So
            Terminus even had his own festival, the Terminalia, when images of the god
            were draped with flower garlands. Today the word shows up in all kinds of
            places, including in the name of numerous hotels worldwide built near a city's
            railway terminus.</p>

            measuring portions of the Earth's surface, probably originally in order to
            determine where the boundaries of Egyptians' farms lay after the annual

        <p>The idea that the Earth is the center of the universe and that the sun revolves
            around it is an ancient one, probably dating back to the earliest humans. Not
            until 1543 did the Polish astronomer Copernicus publish his calculations
            proving that the Earth actually revolves around the sun, thus replacing the
            geocentric model with a heliocentric model (from Helios, the Greek god of
            the sun). But geocentrism remains central to various religious sects around
            the world, and still today one in five adult Americans believes the sun
            revolves around the Earth.</p>

        </p>
        <p>We don't give much thought to geostationary satellites, but many of us rely
            on them daily. Anyone who watches satellite TV or listens to satellite radio is
            dependent on them; the weather photos you see on TV are taken from
            geostationary satellites; and military information gathering via satellite goes
            on quietly day after day. (Though the satellites that provide GPS service for
            your car or cell phone actually aren't geostationary, since they orbit the Earth
            twice a day.) By 2009 there were about 300 geostationary satellites in
            operation, all of them moving at an altitude of about 22,000 miles. Since they
            hover above the same spot on Earth, your receiving dish or antenna doesn't
            have to turn in order to track them.</p>

        <p>&bull; Geothermal power plants convert underground water or steam to electricity.
        </p>
        <p>Geothermal comes partly from the Greek thermos, &ldquo;hot&rdquo; (see
            THERM/THERMO). Most geothermal electricity is provided by power
            plants situated in areas where there is significant activity of the Earth's great
            tectonic plates&mdash;often the same areas where volcanoes are found. But hot
            water from deep underground may be used by cities far from volcanoes to
            heat buildings or sidewalks. And a newer source of geothermal energy relies
            on a less dramatic kind of heat: Individual homeowners can now install heat
            pumps that take advantage of the 50&deg;-60&deg; temperature of the soil near the
            surface to provide heating in cold weather (and air-conditioning in the warm
            months). These very small-scale geothermal systems may eventually supply
            more useful energy than the large power plants.</p>

        <p>The stratosphere (strato- simply means &ldquo;layer&rdquo; or &ldquo;level&rdquo;) lies above the
            earth's weather and mostly changes very little. It contains the ozone layer,
            which shields us from the sun's ultraviolet radiation except where it's been
            harmed by manmade chemicals. The levels of the atmosphere are marked
            particularly by their temperatures; stratospheric temperatures rise only to
            around 32&deg;&mdash;very moderate considering that temperatures in the troposphere

            the 10 million species of living things they contain. The biosphere recycles its
            air, water, organisms, and minerals constantly to maintain an amazingly
            balanced state; human beings should probably do their best to imitate it.

        <p>Converters come in many forms. Travelers to foreign countries who bring

            converter, which can change direct current to alternating current or vice
            versa. In 2009 millions of Americans bought digital-analog converters, small
            box-shaped devices that change the new broadcast digital signal to the analog
            signal that older TV sets were made to receive. A catalytic converter is the

            didn't really approve of such anthropomorphic feelings.
        </p>
        <p>Anthropomorphic means a couple of different things. In its first sense, an
            anthropomorphic cup is a cup in the shape of a human, and anthropomorphic
            gods are human in appearance&mdash;like the Greek and Roman gods, for
            example, even though Socrates and others believed that their fellow Greeks
            had created the gods in their own image rather than the other way around. In
            its second sense, the animal characters in Aesop's fables are anthropomorphic
            since they all have human feelings and thoughts even though they don't look
            like humans. Thus, when the fox calls the grapes sour simply because they're
            out of reach, it's a very human response. Thousands of years after Aesop,
            anthropomorphism is still alive and well, in the animal stories of Beatrix
            Potter, George Orwell's Animal Farm, and hundreds of cartoons and comic
            strips.</p>

            webs. But natural substances may also metamorphose, or undergo
            metamorphosis. Heat and pressure over thousands of years may eventually
            turn tiny organisms into petroleum, and coal into diamonds. And the most
            beloved of natural metamorphoses (notice how this plural is formed) is

            of government. And the most important formative experiences in our own
            lives tend to take place in the first 20 years or so.</p>

        <p>DOC/DOCT comes from the Latin docere, which means &ldquo;to teach.&rdquo; So, for
            instance, a doctor was originally a highly educated person capable of
            instructing others in a field&mdash;which usually wasn't medicine.</p>

        <p>&bull; According to the 19th-century doctrine of &ldquo;papal infallibility,&rdquo; a pope's
            official statements on matters of faith and morals must be regarded as the
            absolute truth.
        </p>
        <p>The original doctrines were those of the Catholic Church, especially as taught
            by the so-called doctors (religious scholars) of the Church. But today a
            doctrine can come from many other sources. Old and established legal
            principles are called legal doctrine. Traditional psychiatrists still follow the
            doctrines of Sigmund Freud. Communist doctrine in the 1920s and '30s was
            often the teachings of Lenin, which were then regarded in the Soviet Union
            as almost sacred. U.S. presidents have given their names to doctrines as well:
            In 1823 the Monroe Doctrine stated that the United States would oppose
            European influence in the Americas, and in 1947 the Truman Doctrine held
            that America would support free countries against enemies outside and
            inside.</p>

        <p>The title of docent is used in many countries for what Americans would call
            an associate professor&mdash;that is, a college or university teacher who has been
            given tenure (see tenure) but hasn't yet achieved the rank of full professor.
            But in the U.S. a docent is a guide who works at a museum, a historical site,
            or even a zoo or a park. Docents are usually volunteers, and their services are
            often free of charge.</p>

        <p>Someone doctrinaire sticks closely to official doctrines or principles. A

            particular crime. A doctrinaire feminist may treat all men as if they were
            identical. A doctrinaire economist might call for a single solution for the
            economic problems in all countries, regardless of their social and cultural

        <p>&bull; In the Army's basic training, sergeants have 11 weeks to indoctrinate their
            new recruits with army attitudes and discipline.
        </p>
        <p>Indoctrinate simply means &ldquo;brainwash&rdquo; to many people today. We frequently
            hear, for example, of religious cults that indoctrinate their members to give
            up their freedom and individuality and to work hard only for a leader's goals.
            But its meaning wasn't originally negative at all. And the fact is that every
            society indoctrinates its young people with the values of its culture; in the
            U.S. we tend to be indoctrinated to love freedom, to be individuals, and to
            work hard for success, among many other things. But we now rarely use
            indoctrinate (or its noun, indoctrination) in a positive way; instead we

            but uneasily calculating the total tuition costs.
        </p>
        <p>The sense of tuition meaning &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; or &ldquo;instruction&rdquo; is mostly used in
            Britain today. In the U.S., tuition almost always means the costs charged by a
            school, college, or university for that teaching. Those costs have tended to
            rise at an alarming rate in recent years. Around 2010 a student could receive a
            four-year college education (tuition, room, and board) at an inexpensive
            public university for less than $50,000, but might have to pay more than
            $200,000 at an expensive private college or university.</p>

            and understanding in personal relations that women are supposed to have.
        </p>
        <p>Intuition is very close in meaning to instinct. The moment a man enters a
            room you may feel you know intuitively or instinctively everything about him
            &mdash;that is, you may intuit his basic personality. Highly rational people may try
            to ignore their intuition and insist on being able to explain everything they
            think, but artists and creative thinkers often tend to rely on their intuitive
            sense of things. Intuition can be closely related to their imagination, which
            seems to come from somewhere just as mysterious. Some psychologists
            claim that the left brain is mainly involved in logical thinking and the right
            brain in intuitive thinking; but the brain is terribly complex, and even if
            there's some truth to this idea, it's not terribly obvious how to make use of it.</p>

            later he had founded the greatest empire ever seen. But it's not so easy to

        <p>&bull; One of a birder's challenges is identifying birds of the less colorful sex in

        </p>
        <p>Dimorphism varies greatly in the animal kingdom. Among mammals, the
            male is generally larger than the female, but other differences in appearance
            tend to be modest. But birds are usually noticeably dimorphic, with the male
            being the more colorful sex; when we imagine a pheasant, a mallard, a
            cardinal, or a peacock, we're almost always picturing the male rather than the
            female. Among spiders the situation is often reversed. The golden orb-weaver
            spider, for example, is spectacularly dimorphic: the female may be 20 times
            the size of the male, and she usually ends up eating him, sometimes even
            while he's mating with her. Many sea creatures, including many fish, take
            care of gender problems by simply changing from one sex into the other.</p>

        <p>Biennial conventions, celebrations, competitions, and sports events come
            every two years. Biennials are plants that live two years, bearing flowers and
            fruit only in the second year. (Carrots and sugar beets are two examples;
            since we're only interested in their roots, we don't wait another year to see
            their flower and fruit.) In contrast, semiannual means &ldquo;twice a year.&rdquo; But no
            one can agree whether biweekly means &ldquo;twice a week&rdquo; or &ldquo;every two weeks,&rdquo;
            and whether bimonthly means &ldquo;twice a month&rdquo; or &ldquo;every two months.&rdquo;
            Maybe we should stop using both of them until we can decide.</p>

            away. And the Cold War arms race was bipolar, since it mainly involved the

            encountered most often today in bipolar disorder, the newer name of what
            used to be called manic-depressive illness, in which the person tends to swing
            between the two extremes, or poles, of high intensity and deep depression,
            with depression being the main condition. Though an extremely serious
            illness, bipolar disorder can often be controlled by the drug lithium.</p>

        <p>TOP comes from topos, the Greek word for &ldquo;place.&rdquo; A topic is a subject
            rather than a place; to the Greeks, the original word meant more or less
            &ldquo;about one place or subject (rather than another)&rdquo;&mdash;which just goes to show
            that it's not always easy to trace a word's meaning from its roots.</p>
        <p />
    </div>

        <p>topical (1) Designed for local application to or treatment of a
            bodily part. (2) Referring to the topics of the day.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; If the topical ointment doesn't work on the rash, the doctor will prescribe an
            antibiotic pill.
        </p>
        <p>Like a topical medicine, a topical reference or story applies to something
            specific, focusing on a topic that's currently in the news. TV comedians often
            use topical humor, making jokes about a currently popular movie or the latest
            political scandal&mdash;if possible, one that just broke that same day. Topical
            humor has a short lifespan, though, because the news keeps changing and the
            new hot topics just keep coming. The medical meaning of topical stays closer
            to the meaning of the root, since it describes something that's put right on the
            place that seems to need it.</p>

        <p>ectopic Occurring or originating in an abnormal place.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; A pacemaker was installed to correct her ectopic heartbeat.
        </p>
        <p>Ectopic is a medical word that means basically &ldquo;out of place.&rdquo; An ectopic
            kidney is located in an abnormal position. In patients with an ectopic
            heartbeat, the electrical signals that trigger the heart muscles originate in an
            abnormal area of the heart. But ectopic most commonly describes a
            pregnancy in which the fertilized egg begins to develop in an area outside the
            uterus, such as in a fallopian tube; such pregnancies may lead to serious
            problems if not treated.</p>

        <p>utopian Relating to an imaginary place in which the
            government, laws, and social conditions are perfect.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Some of the new mayor's supporters had gotten increasingly unrealistic, and
            seemed to expect that she could turn the city into a utopian community.
        </p>
        <p>In 1516 Thomas More published Utopia, a description of a fictional island in
            the Atlantic with an ideal society, in order to draw a sharp contrast with the
            disorderly political situation of his own time. He created the name from topos
            (&ldquo;place&rdquo;) and ou, Greek for &ldquo;no,&rdquo; since he was well aware that nowhere so
            perfect was likely to exist on earth. People have long dreamed of creating
            utopian communities; some of them have joined communes, societies where
            other idealists like themselves have chosen to live in a cooperative way
            according to certain principles. Not just communes but plans of all kinds have
            been labeled utopian by critics. But we can dream, can't we?</p>

        <p>topography (1) The art of showing the natural and man-
            made features of a region on a map or chart. (2) The features of a surface,
            including both natural and man-made features.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Planning the expedition involved careful study of the region's topography.
        </p>
        <p>Topography combines top- with graph-, a root meaning &ldquo;write&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;describe.&rdquo; The topography of the Sahara Desert features shifting sand dunes
            and dry, rocky mountains. A topographic (or topo) map not only shows the
            surface features of a region but also indicates the contours and approximate
            altitude of every location, by means of numerous curving lines, each
            indicating a single elevation. In other words, it shows a &ldquo;three-dimensional&rdquo;
            picture on a two-dimensional surface. Topo maps are commonly used by
            hikers, surveyors, government workers, and engineers, among other people.</p>

        <p>CENTR/CENTER comes from the Greek kentron and the Latin centrum,
            meaning &ldquo;sharp point&rdquo; or &ldquo;center point of a circle.&rdquo; A centrifuge is a spinning
            machine that throws things outward from the center; the apparent force that
            pushes them outward is called centrifugal force.</p>

        <p>eccentric (1) Not following an established or usual style or
            conduct. (2) Straying from a circular path; off-center.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; She keeps a dozen stray cats in her house and is rather eccentric, but her
            neighbors say she's very pleasant and completely harmless.
        </p>
        <p>An eccentric wheel spins unevenly, and an eccentric person is similarly a
            little off-center. Most eccentricities are inoffensive to others, and some may
            even do some good. For instance, riding a bicycle to work might be
            considered eccentric by some people, but it's good exercise and it cuts down
            on pollution. Some eccentrics are just ahead of their time.</p>

        <p>epicenter (1) The location on the earth's surface directly
            above the focus of an earthquake. (2) The center or focus of activity.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The destruction caused by Mexico City's earthquake was extensive because
            the city was at the quake's epicenter.
        </p>
        <p>The meaning of epi- in epicenter is &ldquo;over,&rdquo; so the epicenter of an earthquake
            lies over the center or &ldquo;focus&rdquo; of the quake. Epicenter can also refer to the
            centers of things that may seem in their own way as powerful&mdash;though not as
            destructive&mdash;as earthquakes. Wall Street, for example, might be said to lie at
            the epicenter of the financial world.</p>

        <p>egocentric Overly concerned with oneself; self-centered.

        <p>&bull; He's brilliant but completely egocentric, and the only things he'll talk about
            are his own life and work.
        </p>
        <p>Ego means &ldquo;I&rdquo; in Latin. To an egocentric person, I is the most important
            word in the language. Great artists and writers are often egocentrics; such
            people can be hard to live with, though their egocentricity, an unfortunate
            side effect of their talent, is often forgiven. But ordinary egocentricity, which
            shows up as selfishness, lack of sympathy, and lack of interest in other
            people, usually has little to do with any personal talent or success.</p>

        <p>ethnocentric Marked by or based on the attitude that
            one's own group is superior to others.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Some reviewers criticized the ethnocentric bias that came through in the
            way the film portrayed immigrants.
        </p>
        <p>The Greek word ethnos means &ldquo;nation&rdquo; or &ldquo;people.&rdquo; So ethnocentricity
            shows itself in a lack of respect for other ways of life, and an ethnocentric
            person feels that his or her own nation or group is the cultural center of the
            world. Ethnocentric describes the kind of person who behaves badly when
            traveling in foreign countries, often called an &ldquo;Ugly American&rdquo; (from a book
            and movie of the same name). Whenever you hear someone making fun of
            the way a foreigner speaks English, just remember that it's the foreigner, not
            the person laughing at him, who actually can speak a foreign language.</p>

        <p>DOM comes from the Latin domus, &ldquo;house,&rdquo; and dominus, &ldquo;master,&rdquo; and the
            two are indeed related. In the Bible, King Ahasuerus, angered by his queen's

            been quite independent of Great Britain since the 19th century, it was
            generally referred to as the Dominion of Canada in official documents until at
            least the 1950s. The word has an old-fashioned sound today, and probably
            shows up in history books, historical novels, and fantasy video games more

        <p>Domination may sound like something that's achieved by military force. The

            Napoleon couldn't conquer Spain; and although Adolf Hitler was briefly
            dominant over most of the continent, he never managed to overpower
            England. But the word's earliest appearances don't necessarily involve
            physical force; Chaucer, for instance, speaks of a mind's domination by
            strong drink. So we may observe that a great tennis player has continued his
            domination of the world's courts this season, or that the domination of

        <p>omnivore An animal that eats both plants and other animals.

        <p>&bull; If we're all natural omnivores, she kept asking herself, then why wouldn't
            her toddler eat anything but cashews and peanut butter until the age of four?
        </p>
        <p>Human beings seem to be classic omnivores. Originally living as &ldquo;hunter-
            gatherers,&rdquo; we hunted and fished when possible but also gathered nuts,
            berries, fruits, seeds, and roots for much of our diet. We're physically well
            suited for both tasks; our hands are perfect for picking things, and our build is
            ideal for running down even the fastest game animals because of our great
            stamina. Some 10,000 years ago humans began practicing agriculture
            involving both animals and plants. The other omnivorous mammals include
            chimpanzees, pigs, opossums, porcupines, bears, raccoons, skunks,
            chipmunks, mice and rats, and skunks. But even many mammals classed as
            carnivorous (see VOR) turn out to be capable of shifting to plant foods when
            necessary.</p>

        <p>If you know that potens means &ldquo;power&rdquo; in Latin (see POT), it's not hard to
            guess the meaning of omnipotent. In Christian services and prayers, the Latin
            omnipotens is translated as &ldquo;almighty&rdquo; and always applied to God. But
            omnipotence in a government or ruler is naturally a bit scary; as a British lord
            observed a century ago, &ldquo;Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts
            absolutely.&rdquo; So democracies do their best to make omnipotence impossible.</p>

            several measures together, an omnibus survey may poll the public on a wide
            range of issues, and an omnibus edition of a writer's stories may bring
            together just about all of them. As a noun, omnibus used to mean a large

        <p>HOL/HOLO meaning &ldquo;whole,&rdquo; comes from the Greek word holos, with the

            &ldquo;whole&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the only&mdash;Christian church. Without the capital letter,
            catholic means simply &ldquo;universal&rdquo; or, when describing a person, &ldquo;broad in

        <p>&bull; Environmental scientists tend to be holistic in their views, even when

        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;The whole is greater than the sum of its parts&rdquo; expresses the essence of
            holism, a term coined by the great South African general and statesman Jan
            Smuts in 1926. Holism generally opposes the Western tendency toward
            analysis, the breaking down of wholes into parts sometimes to the point that
            &ldquo;you can't see the forest for the trees.&rdquo; Holism is an important concept in the
            sciences and social sciences, and especially in medicine. Holistic medicine
            tries to treat the &ldquo;whole person&rdquo; rather than focusing too narrowly on single
            symptoms. It emphasizes the connections between the mind and the body,
            avoids the overuse of drugs, and has borrowed such practices from Eastern
            traditions as acupuncture and yoga.</p>

            take the form of a ghostly 3-D moving figure that you can walk around to see
            from all angles. Holograms were invented in 1947 but only perfected after the
            invention of the laser in 1960. Today they're used in such technologies as
            compact-disc players and checkout scanners, and holograms can be created of
            the inside of live internal organs to permit doctors to examine the organs in

        <p>To geologists, we live today in the Holocene epoch, the period that began
            about 10,000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age, when humans first
            began practicing agriculture. But what does Holocene have to do with
            &ldquo;whole&rdquo;? Well, in geological language, the Holocene epoch follows the
            Paleocene (&ldquo;remotely recent&rdquo;), the Eocene (&ldquo;early recent&rdquo;), the Oligocene
            (&ldquo;scarcely recent&rdquo;), the Miocene (&ldquo;less recent&rdquo;), the Pliocene (&ldquo;more

        <p>The Greek word holokaustos means &ldquo;burnt whole.&rdquo; For the early Jews who

            word is used about 200 times in the traditional Greek version of the Old
            Testament, though it rarely appears in English translations. In the 1700s

            When we judge historical people and events in terms of present-day morality

            ships were becoming outdated even before their construction was complete,
            and the only solution was to retrofit the completed craft with the brand-new
            technology. Retrofitting was revived on a massive scale during the energy
            crisis of the 1970s, when new features were added to millions of old houses
            to make them more energy-efficient. Retrofitting is thus different from
            merely renovating, which may not involve any new technology at all.</p>

        <p>Retrospective is partly rooted in the Latin verb specere, &ldquo;to look,&rdquo; so a

            deserving artists; the result is that they frequently win many new fans for the
            person's achievement.</p>

        <p>TEMPOR comes from the Latin tempus, meaning &ldquo;time.&rdquo; A temporary
            repair is meant to last only a short time. The tempo, or speed, of a country-
            and-western ballad is usually different from that of a hip-hop number. The
            Latin phrase Tempus fugit means &ldquo;Time flies,&rdquo; an observation that seems
            more true during summer vacation than in the dead of winter.</p>

        <p>temporal (1) Having to do with time as opposed to eternity;
            having to do with earthly life as opposed to heavenly existence. (2) Having to
            do with time as distinguished from space.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The quick passing of the seasons as we grow older makes us feel the
            fleeting nature of temporal existence.
        </p>
        <p>Temporal existence is often contrasted with spiritual existence, which many
            religions teach is eternal. The American system of government features a
            separation of church and state&mdash;that is, a separation of spiritual and temporal
            authority. But such separation is relatively recent. In past centuries, the
            Roman Catholic Church exerted temporal authority&mdash;that is, political power
            &mdash;throughout much of Europe, and the Church of England has always been
            officially headed by the temporal ruler of Great Britain. Temporal isn't
            always used in religious contexts; for example, child psychologists often
            measure &ldquo;temporal processing&rdquo;&mdash;that is, speed of thinking&mdash;in children with
            mental difficulties. Note that temporal may also mean &ldquo;near the temples (of
            the head)&rdquo;; thus, your brain's temporal lobes are situated at your temples. But
            this temporal is based on a different Latin root.</p>

        <p>contemporary (1) Occurring or existing during the

            current.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The two scientists were contemporary with each other, but neither seemed
            to have heard of the other's existence.
        </p>
        <p>Contemporary can be confusing because of its slightly different meanings. In
            everyday use, it generally means simply &ldquo;modern&rdquo; or &ldquo;new.&rdquo; But before the
            20th century it instead referred only to things from the same era as certain
            other things; so, for instance, Jesus was contemporary with the Roman
            emperors Augustus and Tiberius, and Muhammad was contemporary with
            Pope Gregory the Great. And contemporary is also a noun: thus, Jane
            Austen's contemporaries included Coleridge and Wordsworth, and your own
            contemporaries were born around the same year that you were.</p>

        <p>extemporaneous (1) Composed, performed,
            spoken, or done on the spur of the moment; impromptu or improvised. (2)
            Carefully prepared but delivered without notes.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; It was once common in middle-class homes to make extemporaneous
            speeches, recite poetry, and give little solo song recitals after a dinner with
            guests.
        </p>
        <p>The ability to speak well extemporaneously is an important talent for
            politicians, especially when participating in debates. (Though it's also a good
            idea to have a &ldquo;spin doctor&rdquo; who can go out afterward and tell everyone what
            the candidate really meant to say.) Some people claim there's a difference
            between extemporaneous and impromptu, saying that an extemporaneous
            speech is planned beforehand but not written down, while an impromptu
            speech is genuinely unprepared or off-the-cuff, but today the two words are
            mostly used as synonyms.</p>

        <p>temporize (1) To act in a way that fits the time or occasion; to

        </p>
        <p>&bull; The legislature was accused of temporizing while the budget deficit
            continued to worsen.
        </p>
        <p>The Latin word that temporize comes from meant simply &ldquo;to pass the time&rdquo;;
            the meaning of the English word is different but obviously related. People
            aren't usually admired for temporizing. A political leader faced with a
            difficult issue may temporize by talking vaguely about possible solutions
            without actually doing anything. The point is to avoid taking an action that
            lots of people aren't going to like, in hopes that the problem will somehow go
            away, but the effect is often just to make matters worse.</p>

            Chronicle. A chronometer is a device for measuring time, usually one that's

        <p>Chronic coughing goes on and on; chronic lateness occurs day after day;
            chronic lameness never seems to get any better. Unfortunately, situations that
            we call chronic almost always seem to be unpleasant. We never hear about
            chronic peace, but we do hear about chronic warfare. And we never speak of
            chronic health, only of chronic illness.</p>

        <p>chronology (1) A sequence of events in the order they

        </p>
        <p>&bull; The scandal had gotten so complex that the newspaper had to print a
            chronology showing the order of the numerous events involved.
        </p>
        <p>History is much more than a simple chronology of events, but keeping events
            in chronological order is the first essential step in thinking about it. When,
            for example, historians try to show how World War I prepared the way for
            World War II, tracking the chronology of the events in the years between the
            two wars can help in explaining a complicated historical era.</p>

        <p>anachronism (1) The error of placing a person or thing

        </p>
        <p>&bull; A Model T Ford putt-putting down the highway at 25 miles per hour was an
            anachronism by 1940.
        </p>
        <p>In Shakespeare's time, playwrights didn't worry much about anachronisms.
            When Shakespeare saw his plays performed, all the characters, even Romans
            and Greeks, would have been dressed in the clothes of his own period.
            Macbeth, which is set in the 11th century, contains anachronistic references
            to clocks and cannons, which the real Macbeth would have known nothing
            about. Today, a writer may spend months doing research in order to avoid
            anachronisms in the historical novel she's working on. Using the second
            meaning of the word, we could say that manual typewriters and slide rules
            are anachronisms in these days of computers and calculators, and a person
            who likes doing things the old-fashioned way might himself be described as
            an anachronism.</p>

        <p>&bull; The theory depends on whether the chemical appeared in synchronous

        <p>Communications satellites are usually put into a synchronous (or
            geosynchronous) orbit, circling the earth once every 24 hours and so
            appearing to hover over a single spot on the surface. This type of
            synchronized movement is important, since you have to know where to aim
            your satellite dish. In the computer field, synchronous usually refers to the
            use of a simple timing signal that permits very rapid exchange of data
            between computers. The kind of mysterious coincidence sometimes called
            synchronicity&mdash;such as the appearance of two different comic-strip characters
            named Dennis the Menace in the U.S. and Britain within three days of each

        <p>&bull; The kids in the garage band next door seemed to know six or seven triads
            and a couple of seventh chords.
        </p>
        <p>The best-known type of triad is a type of musical chord consisting of three
            notes. A D-major triad is made up of the notes D, F-sharp, and A; an F-minor
            triad is made up of F, A-flat, and C; and so on. Major and minor triads form
            the basis of tonal music, and songs and other pieces usually end with a triadic
            harmony. In medicine, a triad is a set of three symptoms that go together. The
            Chinese criminal organizations called triads got their name from the
            triangular symbol that they used back when they began, centuries ago, as
            patriotic organizations. Today, with over 100,000 members, the triads operate

        <p>trilogy A series of three creative works that are closely related and

        </p>
        <p>&bull; William Faulkner's famous &ldquo;Snopes trilogy&rdquo; consists of the novels The
            Hamlet, The Town, and The Mansion.
        </p>
        <p>Dozens of tragic trilogies were written for the Greek stage, though only one,
            Aeschylus's great Oresteia (consisting of Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers,
            and The Eumenides), has survived complete. Authors in later years have
            occasionally chosen to create trilogies to allow themselves to develop a
            highly complex story or cover a long span of time. Tolkien's Lord of the
            Rings wasn't actually intended as a trilogy, but since it was published in three
            volumes it's usually called one. George Lucas's three original Star Wars
            movies are an example of a film trilogy (which he followed many years later

        <p>triceratops One of a group of large dinosaurs that lived
            during the Cretaceous period and had three horns, a bony crest or hood, and
            hoofed toes.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The triceratops probably used its three horns for defense against the attacks
            of meat-eating dinosaurs.
        </p>
        <p>The name triceratops, meaning literally &ldquo;three-horned face,&rdquo; refers to the two
            horns above its eyes and the smaller third horn on its snout. Just as striking
            was the frilled hood or ruff that rose behind its head, though no one is quite
            sure what it was for. The triceratops was one of the last dinosaurs to evolve
            and also one of the last to become extinct. It could reach lengths of 30 feet
            and could stand nearly eight feet high. Despite its ferocious looks and three-
            foot-long horns, the triceratops was actually a vegetarian.</p>

        <p>trident A three-pronged spear, especially one carried by various

        <p>&bull; The bronze statue at the middle of the great fountain depicted a sea god
            emerging from the water, wreathed in seaweed and carrying a large trident.
        </p>
        <p>A trident has three prongs or teeth, as the root dent, &ldquo;tooth,&rdquo; tells us. The
            trident has long been used to spear fish in different parts of the world, so
            there's no mystery about why the Greek sea god Poseidon and his Roman
            counterpart Neptune both carry a trident as their symbol. In some gladiator
            exhibitions in ancient Rome, one gladiator, called a retiarius (&ldquo;net man&rdquo;),
            would be equipped as though he were a fisherman, with a weighted net and a

            which an academic year is sometimes divided.

        <p>Semester, which comes from the Latin words for &ldquo;six&rdquo; and &ldquo;month,&rdquo; has
            come to mean half an academic year when the year is divided into two
            segments. When an academic year is divided into three segments, each is
            called a trimester (which is usually a bit more accurate, since each segment
            often is close to three months in length). Some colleges operate on the
            &ldquo;quarter&rdquo; system, with the summer being the fourth quarter, but this just
            means that each quarter is basically a trimester. In a human pregnancy, a
            trimester is three months long, representing one-third of the nine months that

        </p>
        <p>&bull; In Christian art depicting the Trinity, the Holy Spirit is almost always
            shown as a radiant dove.
        </p>
        <p>The nature of the Trinity (or Holy Trinity) has caused centuries of argument
            and division within the Christian faith. The word doesn't actually appear in
            the Bible itself, but the New Testament does speak of the Father, Son, and
            Holy Spirit together; the Father is understood as the protector of the Jews, the
            Son as the savior of mankind, and the Holy Spirit as the preserver of the
            church. Almost all the major Christian sects may be called trinitarian. The
            island of Trinidad is one of many places named with the Spanish translation
            of Trinity.</p>

        <p>triptych (1) A picture or carving made in the form of three panels
            side by side. (2) Something composed or presented in three sections.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The Renaissance produced many beautiful triptychs portraying religious
            scenes that are still used as altarpieces.
        </p>
        <p>Triptych contains the root -ptyche, the Greek word for &ldquo;fold.&rdquo; So a traditional
            painted or carved triptych has three hinged panels, and the two outer panels
            fold in toward the central one. Most triptychs were intended to be mounted
            over a church altar. Many great triptychs were produced in the Renaissance,
            perhaps the most famous being Hieronymus Bosch's Garden of Earthly
            Delights. But major triptychs continued to be produced throughout the 20th
            century by such painters as Francis Bacon.</p>

        <p>trivial Of little value or importance.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; She was so caught up in the trivial details of the trip that she hardly noticed
            the beautiful scenery.
        </p>
        <p>Trivial comes from a Latin word meaning &ldquo;crossroads&rdquo;&mdash;that is, where three
            roads come together. Since a crossroads is a very public place where all kinds
            of people might show up, trivialis came to mean &ldquo;commonplace&rdquo; or &ldquo;vulgar.&rdquo;
            Today the English word has changed slightly in meaning and instead usually
            describes something barely worth mentioning. Mathematicians use the word
            to refer to some part of a proof or definition that's extremely simple and
            needn't be explained, but the rest of us tend to use it just to mean
            &ldquo;unimportant.&rdquo; &ldquo;Small talk&rdquo; at a party, for example, is usually trivial
            conversation, though a trivial excuse for not going on a date (&ldquo;I have to wash
            my hair&rdquo;) might hide an emotion that isn't so trivial (&ldquo;I can't stand the sight of
            you&rdquo;). To trivialize something is to treat it as if it didn't matter, as if it were
            just another triviality.</p>

        <p>ANIM comes from the Latin anima, meaning &ldquo;breath&rdquo; or &ldquo;soul.&rdquo; So, for
            example, an animal is a living, breathing thing&mdash;though human animals have
            often argued about whether other species actually have souls.</p>

        <p>&bull; Her gestures as she talked were so animated that even people across the
            room were watching her.
        </p>
        <p>Animated cartoon characters have been &ldquo;given life&rdquo; by film techniques,
            though the animation of drawings actually goes back to handheld toys in the
            1830s. A child watching the cartoon may also be animated&mdash;squealing,
            laughing, and jumping around&mdash;as can a crowd of hockey fans or a rock-
            concert audience. And the best discussions and arguments are often highly
            animated.</p>

        <p>magnanimous (1) Showing a lofty and courageous
            spirit. (2) Generous and forgiving.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; She was magnanimous in victory, saying she'd been lucky to win and
            praising her opponent's effort.
        </p>
        <p>The basic meaning of magnanimity is &ldquo;greatness of spirit.&rdquo; Thus,
            magnanimity is the opposite of pettiness or &ldquo;smallness.&rdquo; A truly
            magnanimous person can lose without complaining and win without gloating.
            Angry disputes can sometimes be resolved when one side makes a
            magnanimous gesture toward the other. And it's the mark of magnanimity to
            give credit to everyone who worked on a project even if you'd rather it all
            went to you.</p>

        <p>animosity Ill will or resentment.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Legend has it that the animosity between the Greeks and the Trojans began
            with the stealing of the beautiful Helen from her husband, Menelaus.
        </p>
        <p>The important Latin word animus (very closely related to anima) could mean
            a great many things having to do with the soul and the emotions, one of them
            being &ldquo;anger.&rdquo; As an English word, animus has generally meant &ldquo;ill will,&rdquo; so
            it isn't mysterious that animosity means basically the same thing. Animosity
            can exist between two people, two groups or organizations, or two countries,
            and can sometimes lie hidden for years before reappearing. The deep
            animosities that exist between certain ethnic and religious groups sometimes
            seem as if they will last forever.</p>

        <p>The couch you sit on while you watch TV is an inanimate object, as is your
            footrest, your bag of snacks, and your remote control. Spend too much time

        <p>FIG comes from a Latin verb meaning &ldquo;to shape or mold&rdquo; and a noun
            meaning &ldquo;a form or shape.&rdquo; So a figure is usually a shape. A transfiguration
            transforms the shape or appearance of something. And a disfiguring injury
            changes the appearance of part of the body for the worse.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&bull; When the poet says he's been living in the desert, it's a figurative reference
            to his emotional life.
        </p>
        <p>Words and phrases can have both literal and figurative meanings, and we all
            use words with both kinds of meanings every day of our lives. We can
            literally close the door to a room, or we can figuratively close the door to
            further negotiations&mdash;that is, refuse to take part in them. Figurative language
            includes figures of speech, such as similes (&ldquo;she's been like a sister to me&rdquo;)
            and metaphors (&ldquo;a storm of protest&rdquo;). And sometimes it's hard to tell whether
            a phrase is literal or figurative: If I say I &ldquo;picked up&rdquo; a little Spanish in
            Mexico, is that literal or figurative? You've probably noticed that lots of the
            definitions in this book show both a literal meaning (often something
            physical) and a figurative meaning (often nonphysical).</p>

            scientists won a 1962 Nobel Prize for their description of the configuration of
            the DNA molecule. Since then, researchers have studied what different
            configurations within the DNA strands mean and what they control, and
            genetic engineers have tried to configure or reconfigure DNA in new ways to
            prevent or treat diseases.</p>

        <p>effigy An image of a person, especially a crude representation of a

        <p>&bull; The night before the big game, an effigy of the rival coach was burned on a
            huge bonfire.
        </p>
        <p>It was the practice of the ancient Egyptians to bury an effigy of a dead person
            along with that person's body. The idea was that if anything happened to the
            body in the afterlife, the effigy could be used as a spare. Effigy now usually
            refers to crude stuffed figures of the kind that get abused by angry protestors
            and unruly college students. But the small dolls that witches have used to
            bring pain and death on their victims can be called effigies as well. Actually,
            those witches and college kids seem to use their effigies for pretty much the
            same thing.</p>

        <p>A figment is something formed from imaginary elements. Daydreams are

            income on an annual basis or more frequently. Annuities are normally
            contracts with life-insurance companies that specify that payments begin at
            retirement. Company pensions are traditionally doled out in the form of
            annuities, and sweepstakes jackpots may also come as annuities. An annuity
            can be a wise idea if you think you're going to live a long time; however,
            annuities can be tricky and should only be purchased after carefully
            comparing the products offered by various companies.</p>

        <p>A superannuated style is out-of-date&mdash;its time has come and gone. And a
            person who has passed an age limit and been forced to retire may technically
            be called superannuated. But more often superannuated describes people
            who seem somehow to belong to the past. So a 55-year-old surfer might be
            regarded as superannuated by the young crowd riding the waves in Santa
            Cruz, and a superannuated hippie might still be dressing the way he did in
            1972.</p>

            the birth of Christ. But some religious sects, relying on a prophecy in the
            biblical Book of Revelation, speak of a coming millennium when Jesus will
            return to reign on earth for 1,000 years, evil will be banished, and all will live

        <p>Coeval usually describes things that existed together for a very long time or

            speak of one galaxy as being coeval with another, and a period in the history
            of one civilization might be coeval with a similar period in another. As a
            noun, however, coeval may describe people as well; so, for example, two

            in 1900 to over 75 years today. But the most impressive human longevity is
            nothing compared to the 400-year lifespan of an ocean clam found near
            Iceland, or the 5,000-year lifespan of the bristlecone pine, a tree found in the
            western U.S. We may use longevity to talk not only about actual lives but

            Roman state and before the &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo; of culture that we call the Renaissance.
            This same period used to be called the &ldquo;Dark Ages,&rdquo; since it was believed
            that in these years civilization all but vanished. And indeed, for most
            Europeans in these centuries, it was a time of poverty, famine, plague, and
            superstition, rather than the age of magic, dazzling swordplay, towering

        <p>&bull; When European settlers first arrived in North America, they found vast
            tracts of primeval forest, seemingly untouched by human influence.
        </p>
        <p>With its prim- prefix, meaning &ldquo;first,&rdquo; primeval obviously refers to an
            original age. So the word often suggests the earliest periods in the earth's
            history. Myths are often stories of the creation of the world and of its
            primeval beings. The trees in a primeval forest (few of which remain today in
            most countries) may be 400 years old&mdash;not as old as the world, but maybe as
            old as they ever live to. According to scientists, life on earth began in the
            protein-rich waters of the primeval seas and swamps, and the decay of their
            tiny organisms and plant matter over millions of years produced our
            petroleum and coal.</p>

        <p>CORP comes from corpus, the Latin word for &ldquo;body.&rdquo; A corpse is a dead
            body. A corporation is also a kind of body, since it may act almost like an

            with actual feathered wings.
        </p>
        <p>In various religions, including Christianity, corporeal existence is often
            called the opposite of spiritual existence, and corporeal existence, unlike
            spiritual existence, is often said to be contaminated with evil. The word is
            also often used by philosophers, especially when considering the nature of
            reality. For lawyers, corporeal describes physical property such as houses or
            cars, as opposed to something valuable but nonphysical like a good
            reputation.</p>

        <p>&bull; Squire Jenkins had often been described as &ldquo;stout&rdquo; or &ldquo;portly,&rdquo; but more

            even &ldquo;fat.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>The Duchess of Windsor may have said that you can never be too rich or too
            thin, but that's a rather modern point of view. In earlier times in Europe,
            being overweight was considered a sign of wealth and well-being, as
            demonstrated by the corpulence of many European kings. Still today,
            corpulence is thought to be superior to thinness in some of the world's
            cultures. But corpulent and corpulence are less often used than they once
            were, and we're now probably more likely to say &ldquo;obese&rdquo; and &ldquo;obesity.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&bull; She was reminded that, in the public-school system, shaking a child was
            now regarded as unacceptable corporal punishment.
        </p>
        <p>The adjective corporal today usually appears in the phrase corporal
            punishment, which means &ldquo;bodily punishment.&rdquo; This used to include such
            acts as mutilation, branding, imprisonment, and even death. But today
            execution comes under the separate heading of &ldquo;capital punishment,&rdquo; which
            originally involved losing your head (capit- meaning &ldquo;head&rdquo;). Milder forms
            of corporal punishment are used by American parents, and were once
            common in schools as well. Corporal is occasionally used in other ways; in
            the traditional church, the &ldquo;corporal works of mercy&rdquo; include seven helpful
            acts such as sheltering the homeless and burying the dead. Corporal as a
            military rank actually comes from caporal&mdash;which has the same root as
            capital.</p>

        <p>From its roots, incorporate means basically &ldquo;add into a body&rdquo; or &ldquo;form into a
            body.&rdquo; So, for example, a chef might decide to incorporate a couple of new
            ingredients into an old recipe, and then might incorporate that new item into
            the restaurant's dinner menu. The restaurant itself was probably incorporated
            at the beginning, and so is now a corporation&mdash;that is, a &ldquo;body&rdquo; that's legally
            allowed to act like a single person in certain ways, even if it may have many
            individual employees. As you can see, the two meanings turn out to be fairly

            situations involving other people can require the kind of extreme sensitivity
            that our fingertips possess. As Lincoln once said, &ldquo;Tact is the ability to
            describe others as they see themselves,&rdquo; which doesn't usually come
            naturally. Someone tactful can soothe the feelings of the most difficult

            and reading. Many longtime readers resist using e-books, saying they miss
            the tactile sensations of leafing through an actual book. And the blind, using

        <p>Something that's literally tangible can be touched. A rock is tangible, and so
            is a broken window; if the rock is lying next to the window, it could be
            tangible evidence of vandalism. When we say that the tension in a room is
            tangible, we mean we feel it so strongly that it seems almost physical. But if
            we're being literal, tension, like hope, happiness, and hunger, is literally
            intangible&mdash;it may be real, but it can't be touched. When lawyers talk about
            an intangible asset, they might mean something like a company's good
            reputation&mdash;very valuable, but not quite touchable.</p>

        <p>CODI/CODE comes from the Latin codex, meaning &ldquo;trunk of a tree&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;document written on wooden tablets.&rdquo; A code can be either a set of laws or a
            system of symbols used to write messages. To encode a message is to write it
            in code. A genetic code, transmitted by genes, is a set of instructions for
            everything from blood type to eye color.</p>

        <p>codex A book in handwritten form, especially a book of
            Scripture, classics, or ancient texts.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; There on the shelves of the monastery library they saw codex after codex,
            all carefully copied and illustrated by hand.
        </p>
        <p>In the 3rd and 4th centuries A.D., the codex began to replace the older scroll
            as the preferred form for longer writings. Unlike the scroll, this wonderful
            invention permitted writing on both sides of a sheet, made it easy to locate a
            particular passage, and could contain a very long piece of writing. Codices
            (note this unusual plural form) were usually written on parchment, the
            specially prepared skin of a sheep or goat, or papyrus, the ancestor of paper.
            Because codices were handwritten, there were few copies of any single
            codex, and sometimes only a single copy. Today we no longer write our
            books in longhand, but the modern book has kept basically the same form as
            the original codices.</p>

        <p>codicil (1) An amendment or addition made to a will. (2) An

        </p>
        <p>&bull; With the birth of each new grandchild, the old man added a new codicil to
            his will.
        </p>
        <p>A codicil is literally a &ldquo;little codex,&rdquo; a little bit of writing on a small piece of
            writing material, used to add to or change something about a larger piece of
            writing. A codicil to a will can change the terms of the original will
            completely, so it generally requires witnesses just like the will itself, though
            in some states a handwritten codicil may not. In mystery novels, such
            changes have been known to cause murders; in real life, codicils aren't
            usually quite that exciting.</p>

        <p>&bull; In the 6th century B.C., the great statesman Solon newly codified the laws
            of Athens, replacing the harsh legal code of Draco.
        </p>
        <p>A code is a collection of laws arranged in an orderly way; famous examples
            include the Code of Hammurabi, from about 1760 B.C. in ancient Babylon,
            and the Napoleonic Code, produced at Napoleon's orders in 1804. Laws that
            have been included in a code have been codified. The rules of baseball
            differed greatly from one place to another until they were codified by
            Alexander Cartwright in 1845; they haven't changed much since, though we
            don't know what Cartwright would say about the designated hitter.</p>

        <p>&bull; The Allies were able to decode many important secret messages sent by the
            Germans and Japanese in World War II.
        </p>
        <p>To decode is to take out of code and put into understandable language. (Its
            opposite is encode, &ldquo;to put into coded form.&rdquo;) But dreams may sometimes
            also be decoded; psychologists often try to decode the images of their
            patients' dreams so as to understand the emotions behind them. And readers
            must often decode what a novel or story or poem is telling them, which may
            require two or three readings. Decipher is often a synonym, though we now
            use it when talking about reading difficult handwriting.</p>

        <p>Signify basically means &ldquo;to make a sign or signal.&rdquo; One of its synonyms is
            indicate; the index finger is the finger you point with, so to indicate is
            essentially to point to something. Significant means &ldquo;important&rdquo; and
            significance means &ldquo;importance&rdquo;; similarly, insignificant means
            &ldquo;unimportant&rdquo; and insignificance means &ldquo;lack of importance.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Insignia are the official signs of rank, titles, or awards. Medals are an
            example, as are the crowns of monarchs. The Catholic church employs such
            insignia as the red robes of cardinals. U.S. presidents have the presidential
            seal, which appears on the stand when they're giving a speech. But most of us
            think first of the bars, stripes, badges, and patches of military rank.</p>

        <p>signatory A person or government that signs an agreement

        <p>&bull; More than a dozen countries were signatories to the agreement setting limits

        </p>
        <p>A signatory puts his or her signature on a document that is also signed by
            others. In 1215 the English barons revolted against King John and forced him
            to join them as a signatory to the Magna Carta. This agreement stated the
            barons' own duties to the King but also assigned the barons clear rights and
            limited the King's power over them. Though the Magna Carta did nothing for
            the common people, it's often been called the first step toward democracy in
            the English-speaking countries.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&bull; The charters of lands and rights of the early American colonies were
            confirmed with the king's signet.
        </p>
        <p>Signets have been used for thousands of years. The design of a signet is
            personalized for its owner, and no two are alike. The ancients used signets to
            mark their possessions and to sign contracts. In later years signets were used
            to stamp a blob of hot wax sealing a folded secret document so that it couldn't
            be opened and read without the design being broken. The Pope still wears a
            signet, called the Fisherman's Ring, which is carved with a figure of St. Peter
            encircled with the Pope's name; after a Pope's death, the ring is destroyed and
            a new one is made.</p>

        <p>QUADR/QUART comes from Latin words meaning &ldquo;four&rdquo; or &ldquo;fourth.&rdquo; In
            English, a quart is one-fourth of a gallon, just as a quarter is one-fourth of a
            dollar. A quadrangle has four sides and angles but isn't necessarily square.

        <p>quadrant (1) A quarter of a circle. (2) Any of the four quarters
            into which something is divided by two lines intersecting at right angles.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Washington, D.C., like a number of other cities, is divided into quadrants
            called Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Southeast.
        </p>
        <p>This word is used for a traditional instrument, used to make calculations of
            altitude and traditionally employed by sailors to navigate, which has a piece
            shaped like a quarter of a circle. A quadrant shower is a shower that fits
            snugly into a bathroom corner and displays a curved front, making a quadrant
            shape on the floor. But perhaps quadrant is used most often today to name a
            particular quarter of a city.</p>

        <p>quadrille A square dance popular in the 18th and 19th century,
            made up of five or six patterns for four couples.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Quadrilles were very popular at balls in the American South before the Civil
            War.
        </p>
        <p>The quadrille, named for its four couples that form the sides of a square,
            seems to have begun as a French country dance. In the 18th century it became
            fashionable among the French nobility; as performed by elegantly dressed
            aristocrats, it became slow and formal. It crossed over to England and from
            there to New England, where it turned back into a dance for the common
            people. It soon evolved into the American square dance, a lively type of
            dance that employs a &ldquo;caller&rdquo; to make sure everyone remembers the steps.</p>

        <p>quadriplegic Paralyzed in both arms and both legs.

        <p>&bull; A motorcycle accident in her teens had killed her boyfriend and left her a
            quadriplegic.
        </p>
        <p>Quadriplegia is the result of injury or illness, almost always affecting the
            spine. Though a paraplegic has lost the use only of his or her legs,
            quadriplegics are paralyzed in all four limbs. Today voice-activated
            wheelchairs help the quadriplegic get around, and houses can be equipped
            with similar systems to operate lights and appliances; monkeys have even
            been trained to assist quadriplegics with everyday tasks. The work of the
            quadriplegic actor Christopher Reeve has led to remarkable advances in
            developing new nerve connections, enabling some determined paraplegics
            and quadriplegics to walk again.</p>

        <p>Most chemical names are made up of two or more Greek and Latin roots

            for &ldquo;circle,&rdquo; means &ldquo;four-ringed&rdquo;&mdash;that is, &ldquo;consisting of four fused
            hydrocarbon rings.&rdquo; Antibiotics work against bacteria and other tiny
            organisms (but not viruses); tetracycline, which comes from a kind of soil
            bacteria, is one of the most used of the antibiotics. &ldquo;Broad-spectrum&rdquo;
            antibiotics work well on numerous organisms; thus, tetracycline has proved

        <p>Vivaldi's Four Seasons could be called a tetralogy, since it's a set of four
            violin concertos, one for each season of the year. Eight of Shakespeare's
            history plays are often grouped into two tetralogies. Wagner's great Ring of
            the Nibelung, an opera tetralogy based on Norse mythology, contains about
            18 hours of music. The original tetralogies, however, were sets of four plays
            by the same author performed together in ancient Greece; the first three were
            always tragedies, and the last was a wild comedy. Tetralogies were written by
            such great dramatists as Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripedes; unfortunately,

        <p>tetrapod A vertebrate with two pairs of limbs.

        </p>
        <p>The earliest tetrapods, or &ldquo;four-footed&rdquo; animals, were mammal-like reptiles
            that evolved before the rise of the dinosaurs and ranged from mouse-sized to
            cow-sized. Today the tetrapods include the reptiles, the amphibians, the birds,

        <p>CAPIT from the Latin word for &ldquo;head,&rdquo; caput, turns up in some important
            places. The head of a ship is its captain, and the capital of a state or country
            is where the &ldquo;head of state&rdquo; works. A capital letter stands head and shoulders
            above a lowercase letter, as well as at the head (beginning) of a sentence.</p>

        <p>capitalism An economic system based on private
            ownership, private decisions, and open competition in a free market.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In the 1980s, the leaders of the free world had faith that capitalism and a
            free-market economy would solve all our problems.
        </p>
        <p>Capital is wealth&mdash;that is, money and goods&mdash;that's used to produce more
            wealth. Capitalism is practiced enthusiastically by capitalists, people who use
            capital to increase production and make more goods and money. Capitalism
            works by encouraging competition in a fair and open market. Its opposite is
            often said to be socialism. Where a capitalist economy encourages private
            actions and ownership, socialism prefers public or government ownership
            and control of parts of the economy. In a pure capitalist system, there would
            be no public schools or public parks, no government programs such as Social
            Security and Medicare, and maybe not even any public highways or police.
            In a pure socialist system, there wouldn't be any private corporations. In other
            words, there's just about no such thing as pure capitalism or pure socialism in
            the modern world.</p>

        <p>capitulate To surrender or stop resisting; give up.

            move forward.
        </p>
        <p>Capitulation often refers to surrender on the battlefield. Originally it only
            referred to surrender according to an agreement, though that part of the
            meaning is often absent. Today a teacher can capitulate to her students' cries
            of protest against a homework assignment, or a father can capitulate to his
            kids' pleas to stop for ice cream, when the only terms of the agreement are
            that they'll stop complaining.</p>

            Scots, and two of Henry VIII's unfortunate wives. The invention of the
            guillotine in the 18th century was meant to make execution swifter and more

        </p>
        <p>Capitulation originally meant the organizing of material under headings. So
            recapitulation usually involves the gathering of the main ideas in a brief
            summary. But a recapitulation may be a complete restatement as well. In
            many pieces of classical music, the recapitulation, or recap, is the long final
            section of a movement, where the earlier music is restated in the main key.</p>

        <p>ANTHROP comes from the Greek word for &ldquo;human being.&rdquo; So an
            anthropomorphic god, such as Zeus or Athena, basically looks and acts like a
            human. And in Aesop's fables and many animated cartoons, animals are
            usually anthropomorphized and behave exactly like furry, four-legged human
            beings.</p>

        <p>anthropoid Any of several large, tailless apes.

        <p>&bull; The chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, gibbons, and bonobos are all
            classified as anthropoids.
        </p>
        <p>With its suffix -oid, meaning &ldquo;resembling,&rdquo; the word anthropoid means
            literally &ldquo;resembling a human being.&rdquo; Anthropoid apes are so called because
            they resemble humans more closely than do other primates such as monkeys
            and lemurs. Some even spend a good deal of time walking on their hind legs.
            Anthropoids are, of course, highly intelligent (though maybe no more so than
            many monkeys), and some of them use sticks and stones as tools. (But if you
            call someone an anthropoid, you're probably not complimenting his
            intelligence.)</p>

        <p>anthropology The science and study of human beings.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; By studying the cultures of primitive peoples, anthropology may give us a
            better understanding of our own culture.
        </p>
        <p>Anthropologists, those who study the whys and wherefores of human
            existence, today look not only at the tribes of the Amazon but also at the
            neighborhoods of Brooklyn or Santa Monica. Every group and every culture
            now seems to be possible material for anthropology. Some anthropologists
            specialize in the study of human evolution, some study human language,
            some study archaeology, and some study human culture through the ages.
            Unlike historians, they tend to focus less on what has been recorded in
            writings than on what can be discovered in other ways.</p>

        <p>&bull; Few characters in literature are more misanthropic than Ebenezer Scrooge,
            who cares for nothing but money.
        </p>
        <p>Jonathan Swift was famous for the misanthropy of works such as Gulliver's
            Travels which make fun of all kinds of human foolishness. But in spite of his
            apparent misanthropic attitude, he spent a third of his income on founding a
            hospital and another third on other charities&mdash;certainly not the acts of a true
            misanthrope. Today we often use synonyms such as cynic and grinch for
            misanthropic types&mdash;while hoping we don't meet too many of them.</p>

        <p>lycanthropy (1) A delusion that one has become a wolf.

        </p>
        <p>&bull; The local farmers avoided the residents of the village in the next valley,
            who had long been suspected of grave robbing and lycanthropy.
        </p>
        <p>The Greek word for &ldquo;wolf,&rdquo; lykos, combines with the anthro- root to produce
            the meaning &ldquo;wolfman.&rdquo; In European folklore, dating back to the ancient
            Greeks and Romans, there are men who change into wolves at night and
            devour animals, people, or graveyard corpses before returning to human form
            at dawn. Werewolves, or lycanthropes, may be evil and possessed by the
            devil, or may instead be the victims of a werewolf bite and thereby cursed to
            change into wolf form at the full moon. The werewolf's evil intention is
            shown by its eating only part of the animal or corpse, rather than all of it like
            a truly hungry wolf.</p>

        <p>KINE comes from the Greek word kinesis, meaning &ldquo;movement.&rdquo; Kinetic
            energy is the energy of motion (as opposed to potential energy, the kind of
            energy held by a stretched elastic band). Kinetic art is art that has moving
            parts, such as Alexander Calder's famous mobiles. And cinema, the art of

        <p>Kinesiologists study the acquisition of motor skills, the mechanical aspects of

            with and without disabilities, or work with patients recovering from disease,
            accidents, and surgery. As a field of research, kinesiology focuses

        <p>&bull; Noises Off is a hyperkinetic stage farce that moves at a breathless pace for a
            full hour and a half.
        </p>
        <p>Since the prefix hyper- means &ldquo;above, beyond&rdquo; (see HYPER), hyperkinetic
            describes motion beyond the usual. The word is usually applied to children,
            and often describes the condition of almost uncontrollable activity or
            muscular movements called attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
            Kids with ADHD are usually not just hyperkinetic but also inattentive,
            forgetful, and flighty. Though they're often treated with drugs, many experts
            believe there are better ways of dealing with the problem. Lots of people now
            shorten both hyperactive and hyperkinetic to simply hyper (&ldquo;He's been hyper

        </p>
        <p>Kinescope, originally a trademark for the cathode-ray tube in a TV, later
            became the name for a film of a TV screen showing a live broadcast. In order
            for a program to be seen beyond New York in the early days of TV, a
            kinescope had to be shipped from station to station. Though grainy and fuzzy,
            these were for a time the only way of capturing live shows. But in 1951 Desi
            Arnaz and Lucille Ball decided to film their comedy show rather than to
            broadcast it live, and in a few years live broadcast comedy and drama had

            living languages, for example, are dynamic rather than static, changing from
            year to year even when they don't appear to be. A bustling commercial city
            like Hong Kong is intensely dynamic, constantly changing and adapting. A
            dynamic relationship&mdash;for example, the relationship between housing values
            and interest rates charged by banks&mdash;is one that changes all the time.

        <p>&bull; Even as they entered the power plant, the roar of the water covered the
            sound of the immense dynamos.
        </p>
        <p>The dynamo was introduced in 1832 to produce electricity for commercial
            use. Like all later generators, the original dynamos changed mechanical
            energy (produced by steam, which was itself produced by burning coal) into
            electricity. The word is less used today than it once was, since it's often
            applied only to generators that produced direct electric current (DC) rather
            than alternating current (AC), which is now the standard. A human dynamo is
            a person who seems to have unlimited energy, such as New York's legendary
            mayor Fiorello La Guardia, whose forcefulness and vigor matched that of his
            intensely dynamic city.</p>

        <p>aerodynamics (1) A science that studies the movement
            of gases such as air and the way that objects move through such gases. (2)
            The qualities of an object that affect how easily it is able to move through the
            air.

        <p>&bull; Early automobile designs were based on the boxlike carriages drawn by
            horses, back when no one was even thinking about aerodynamics.
        </p>
        <p>Aerodynamics began as a science around the time of the Wright brothers' first
            manned flights. Since then, it's become important to the building not only of
            aircraft and automobiles but also of rockets and missiles, trains, ships, and
            even such structures as bridges and tall buildings, which often have to
            withstand strong winds. An aerodynamic vehicle is one whose design helps it
            achieve the greatest speed and most efficient use of fuel. But although we
            might casually call any sleek car design aerodynamic, true aerodynamics is
            practiced not by artistic product designers but instead by highly trained
            scientists, and many people's lives depend on their work.</p>

        <p>Bernoulli's principle, which is basic to the science of hydrodynamics, says
            that the faster a fluid substance flows, the less outward pressure it exerts. It
            shows the close relationship between hydrodynamics and aerodynamics
            (which deals with the movement of air and other gases), since it can partly
            explain how air will &ldquo;lift&rdquo; an airplane by the way it flows over the wings, and
            how a spoiler helps keep a race car's wheels pressed to the ground as it
            accelerates. Hydrodynamics is sometimes applied today in studying the
            surface of the planets and even the stars. As used informally by boaters,
            hydrodynamic often means &ldquo;hydrodynamically efficient.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>In Shakespeare's King Lear, the old king is degraded by the daughters he has
            given his kingdom to. He finds it degrading, for instance, when the number
            of his guards is reduced from 100 to 25. His degradation seems complete
            when, after going mad, he's reduced to living in the wilderness. As you can

            change that's shown on a graph may have a sloped gradient. Suppose the
            graph's horizontal axis shows the passage of time and its vertical axis shows
            some activity; if the activity is happening very fast, then the gradient of the
            line on the graph will be steep, but if it's slow the gradient will be gentle, or

        <p>Every time a pope dies, there's an interregnum period before a new one is
            elected by the cardinals. In most democratic systems, however, the law
            specifies who should take office when a president or prime minister dies
            unexpectedly, and since the power usually passes automatically, there's no
            true interregnum. The question of succession&mdash;that is, of who should take
            over when a country's leader dies&mdash;has often presented huge problems for
            countries that lacked a constitution, and in monarchies it hasn't always been
            clear who should become king or queen when a monarch dies. The
            interregnum following the death of Edward VI in 1553, for instance, was
            briefly suspended when Lady Jane Grey was installed as Queen; nine days

            jewels (crown, scepter, orb, sword, etc.) that lend luster to royal coronations.
            Academic regalia&mdash;the caps, gowns, and hoods worn by students receiving
            their degrees&mdash;link institutions to their past by preserving the dress worn at
            universities since their beginnings in the Middle Ages, when long hooded

        <p>In Britain, the years from the time when George III was declared insane until
            his death (1811&ndash;1820) are known as the Regency period, since in these years
            his son, the future George IV, served as Prince Regent, or acting monarch.
            (Sometimes the term covers the period up to the end of George IV's own
            reign in 1830.) The Regency is remembered for its elegant architecture and
            fashions, its literature (especially the works of Jane Austen), and its politics.
            Today hotels, furniture, and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic carry the
            name &ldquo;Regency&rdquo; to identify with the period's style, and hundreds of modern
            romance novels&mdash;called simply &ldquo;Regencies&rdquo;&mdash;have been set in the period.
            Though there have been dozens of European regencies over the centuries, for

        <p>&bull; Most teachers do their best to correct their students' mistakes without
            seeming hypercritical.
        </p>
        <p>The important prefix hyper- means &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; or &ldquo;beyond&rdquo; (see HYPER),
            so hypercritical means basically &ldquo;too fussy.&rdquo; In TV and film comedies, the
            mother-in-law is just about always hypercritical, since the person her child
            married is never good enough for her. But other parents, spouses, and even
            children can be just as bad, so we should all be careful. If your father asks
            what you think of his new experimental meatloaf and you say it needs a pinch
            of oregano, you're being constructive; if you say he should cut down on the
            sawdust next time, you're probably being hypercritical.</p>

        <p>hematocrit The ratio of the volume of red blood cells to
            whole blood.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The latest blood test had revealed that her hematocrit had risen considerably
            and was almost back to normal.
        </p>
        <p>Our blood is mostly made up of four components: plasma, red blood cells,
            white blood cells, and colorless blood cells called platelets. An instrument
            called a hematocrit (because it &ldquo;judges&rdquo; the blood) is used to separate a
            sample of blood into its components. The normal hematocrit for men is about
            48%, for women about 38%. An abnormal proportion of red blood cells,
            either too many or too few, is a good early indicator of many diseases. So
            when you give blood as part of a physical exam, your hematocrit is one of the
            findings your doctor will often check.</p>

        <p>JUR comes from the Latin verb jurare, &ldquo;to swear, take an oath,&rdquo; and the

            on the law. And a personal injury was originally something done to you that a

        <p>&bull; As a young lawyer his heroes were the crusaders of 20th-century
            jurisprudence, especially Louis Brandeis and Thurgood Marshall.
        </p>
        <p>Jurisprudence as a study may have begun in the Roman empire, where
            schools of law were first established. And Roman jurisprudence, like so many
            other things the Romans created, served as the model in later centuries
            throughout the Western world. And like many other legal words,
            jurisprudence is used only in formal writing.</p>

        <p>abjure To reject formally.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The Spanish Inquisition forced many Jews to abjure their religion and adopt
            Christianity or be burned at the stake.
        </p>
        <p>From its Latin roots, abjure would mean literally &ldquo;to swear away.&rdquo; Thus,
            after the holidays many people abjure all sweets and fattening foods, often
            making their vow in front of friends or relatives. Abjure is often confused
            with adjure, which means &ldquo;to command solemnly, as if under oath.&rdquo; Thus, a
            judge might adjure a criminal to change his ways; but it's up to the criminal to
            abjure a life of crime.</p>

        <p>perjury The crime of telling a lie under oath.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Found guilty of perjury for lying under oath in front of a Congressional
            committee, he was sentenced to two years in prison.
        </p>
        <p>The prefix per- in Latin often meant &ldquo;harmfully.&rdquo; So witnesses who perjure
            themselves do harm to the truth by knowingly telling a lie. Not all lying is
            perjury, only lying under oath; so perjury generally takes place either in court
            or before a legislative body such as Congress. To avoid committing perjury, a
            witness or defendant may &ldquo;take the Fifth&rdquo;: that is, refuse to answer a question
            because the answer might be an admission of guilt, and the Fifth Amendment
            to the Constitution forbids forcing a citizen to admit to being guilty of a
            crime.</p>

        <p>de jure Based on or according to the law.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The country is a de jure democracy, but since one party controls all the
            media outlets it really isn't one.
        </p>
        <p>Coming straight from Latin, de jure is a term used mostly, but not always, in
            legal writing. Sometimes it's not enough to have something written into law;
            if a law isn't enforced, it might as well not exist. And if ordinary citizens are
            too scared of what would happen to them if they exercised their rights, then
            they don't really have those rights at all. Unfortunately, many countries have
            constitutions and laws that sound good but turn out not to have much effect.
            So de jure is almost always used in contrast to something else; its opposite is
            de facto (see de facto).</p>

        <p>pentameter A line of poetry consisting of five metrical

        <p>&bull; Shakespeare's tragedies are written mainly in blank verse, which is
            unrhymed iambic pentameter.
        </p>
        <p>In a line of poetry written in perfect iambic pentameter, there are five
            unstressed syllables, each of which is followed by a stressed syllable. Each
            pair of syllables is a metrical foot called an iamb. Much of the greatest poetry
            in English has been written in iambic pentameter; Chaucer, Shakespeare, and
            Milton used it more than any other meter. Robert Frost's line &ldquo;I'm going out
            to clean the pasture spring&rdquo; is an example of it; his &ldquo;And miles to go before I
            sleep&rdquo; is instead an example of iambic tetrameter, with only four accented

        <p>In ancient Greek, pentekoste meant &ldquo;fiftieth day&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the fiftieth day

            described in the Bible that took place fifty days after Christ's resurrection,
            when the apostles heard the rush of a mighty wind, saw tongues of fire
            descending on them, and heard the Holy Spirit speaking from their own
            mouths but in other tongues (languages). &ldquo;Speaking in tongues,&rdquo; when
            everyone in a congregation may begin talking in languages that no one can
            understand, is the best-known practice of Pentecostals. Pentecostals belong to
            many different denominations; with growing numbers especially in Latin

        <p>The philosophers and scientists of the ancient world and the Middle Ages
            believed that the world we inhabit was entirely made up of four elements:
            earth, air, fire, and water. Aristotle added a fifth element, the aether or ether,
            by which he meant the material that fills the rest of space, mostly invisibly
            but sometimes taking the form of stars and planets. Many writers described
            the element as a kind of invisible light or fire. In the Middle Ages, it was
            referred to as the quinta essentia (&ldquo;fifth element&rdquo;). It isn't surprising that the
            quinta essentia came to stand for anything so perfect that it seemed to surpass

        <p>BIO comes from the Greek word for &ldquo;life,&rdquo; and forms the base for many
            English words. Biology, for instance, is the study of living forms and life
            processes; the biosphere is the entire area of and above the earth where life
            can exist; and biotechnology is the use of living organisms to create useful
            products.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&bull; Bionic feet and hands for amputees have ceased to be mere sci-fi fantasies
            and are becoming realities.
        </p>
        <p>The science of bionics uses knowledge about how biological systems work to
            help solve engineering problems. The material Velcro, for example, was
            inspired by the way burrs behave when they stick to your clothes, and some
            computer chips are now wired in ways that imitate the &ldquo;wiring&rdquo; of the brain
            and nervous system. But in popular use, the adjective bionic almost always
            describes artificial limbs or other bodily parts that work as much like real
            ones as possible. A perfect bionic arm would move and function as easily as a
            real arm&mdash;a goal we're rapidly getting closer to.</p>

        <p>biopsy The removal and examination of tissue, cells, or fluids
            from a living body.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Everyone felt relieved when the results of the biopsy showed the tumor
            wasn't cancerous.
        </p>
        <p>Matter examined in a biopsy is always taken from a living organism. Most
            biopsies are done by using a needle to extract tissue or fluid, but some may
            instead require cutting, and others may amount to nothing more than
            swabbing the inside of the patient's cheek. Biopsies are best known as a
            means of detecting cancer, but a doctor may also take a biopsy of heart
            muscle to investigate suspected heart disease, for example, or perform a
            biopsy on a pregnant woman to test for disorders in the fetus.</p>

        <p>biodegradable Able to be broken down into harmless
            substances by microorganisms or other living things.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Though the advertisements promised that the entire package was
            biodegradable, environmentalists expressed their doubts.
        </p>
        <p>In biodegradable, with its root grad, &ldquo;to step or move,&rdquo; and its prefix de-
            &ldquo;downward,&rdquo; we get an adjective describing things that can be broken down
            into basic substances through normal environmental processes. Animal and
            plant products are normally biodegradable, but mineral substances such as
            metals, glass, and plastics usually are not. Newly developed biodegradable
            plastics are now appearing in numerous products. However, &ldquo;biodegradable&rdquo;
            products can vary greatly in how long they take to break down. A loaf of
            bread may require only a couple of weeks, and a piece of paper may vanish in
            a couple of months, but some &ldquo;biodegradable&rdquo; plastic milk cartons may take
            four or five years.</p>

        <p>symbiosis (1) The close living together of two different
            forms of life in a way that benefits both. (2) A cooperative relationship
            between two people or groups.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The lichen that grows on rocks is produced by the symbiosis of a fungus
            and an alga, two very different organisms.
        </p>
        <p>With its prefix sym-, &ldquo;with,&rdquo; symbiosis expresses the notion of cooperation
            between living things. Symbiotic associations are found throughout the plant
            and animal world. You may have read, for instance, of the little blackbird
            plover, which picks the teeth of the fierce African crocodile. Or the bird
            called the African honeyguide, which leads a little mammal called the ratel to
            a bees' nest, which the ratel, protected from the bees by its thick fur, then
            breaks open, and both it and the honeyguide feast on the honey. Or even our
            own bodies, which are home to millions of bacteria&mdash;especially the
            bacterium E. coli in our intestines&mdash;and neither we nor E. coli could live
            without the other. You can probably think of plenty of human relationships
            that could be called symbiotic as well.</p>

            were roommates at Cornell University.
        </p>
        <p>The traditional Greek name for the first and best-known book of the Bible is
            Genesis, meaning &ldquo;origin.&rdquo; Genesis tells the stories of the creation, Adam
            and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's ark, the Tower of Babel, Abraham and his
            sons, and more&mdash;the stories that explain how the world and humanity were
            created, as well as much about how humanity, and especially the descendants
            of Abraham, relate to the rest of the world. Today we use genesis to refer to
            the creative beginnings of much smaller things, but never unimportant ones.</p>

        <p>generator A machine by which mechanical energy is

        </p>
        <p>&bull; The jungle settlement depended on a large generator, which provided
            electricity for a couple of hours each morning and evening.
        </p>
        <p>Generators work by rotating a coil of wire in a magnetic field, causing a
            current to flow in the wire. A generator may be a huge spinning turbine
            powered by water, wind, steam, gas, or nuclear reactions, which sends
            electricity out through power lines to thousands of customers. But normally
            when we use the word, we're thinking of a small machine powered by
            gasoline or diesel, such as you might keep in your basement for those times
            when a storm knocks out your power, to create electricity right in front of
            your eyes. A special kind of generator called an alternator powers a car's
            electrical system (including its lights, power steering, etc.) while the car is
            running.</p>

        <p>&bull; Opera was a new genre for her, since all her compositions up until then had
            been songs and chamber music.
        </p>
        <p>Genre, as you might guess from the way it sounds, comes straight from
            French, a language based on Latin. It's closely related to genus, a word you
            may have encountered in biology class. Both words contain the gen- root
            because they indicate that everything in a particular category (a genre or a
            genus) belongs to the same &ldquo;family&rdquo; and thus has the same origins. So the
            main genres of classical music would include symphonies, sonatas, and
            opera, and the major genres of literature would include novels, short stories,
            poetry, and drama. But within the category of novels, we could also say that
            detective novels, sci-fi novels, romance novels, and young-adult novels are
            separate genres.</p>

        <p>&bull; Although she knows all too well that the tobacco in cigarettes is
            carcinogenic, she's too addicted to quit.
        </p>
        <p>It sometimes seems as if the list of carcinogenic substances gets longer every
            day. A substance such as a food additive that's been in common use for years
            may unexpectedly show signs of being carcinogenic in laboratory
            experiments. When that happens, the suspected carcinogen will often have to
            be withdrawn from the market. When a building material like asbestos turns
            out to be a carcinogen, it may also have to be physically removed from
            buildings. English has hundreds of other scientific words ending in -genic
            (such as allergenic), and in almost all of them the ending means &ldquo;causing.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>For most of us, being described as a functionary wouldn't be a compliment.
            The word refers especially to a person of lower rank, with little or no
            authority, who must carry out someone else's orders. Bureaucrat is often a
            synonym. However, functionary can also refer to the world beyond
            government and offices; a character in a play, for example, could be called a
            functionary if it was obvious that her sole function was to keep the plot

        <p>If you know that de- often means &ldquo;the opposite of&rdquo; (see DE), it's easy to
            guess the meaning of defunct. Shakespeare seems to have been the first writer
            to use this adjective, in Henry V. Defunct American political parties include
            the Greenback Party, the Readjuster Party, and the Nullifier Party. Defunct

            movies&mdash;Godzilla, The Fly, The Incredible Shrinking Man&mdash;used to be made
            on the subject of weird mutations, changes in normal people or animals that
            usually end up causing death and destruction. What causes the unfortunate
            victim to mutate may be a mysterious or alien force, or perhaps invisible
            radiation. Though the science in these films isn't always right on target, the
            scare factor of an army of mutants can be hard to beat.</p>

        <p>commute (1) To exchange or substitute; especially to change a
            penalty to another one that is less severe. (2) To travel back and forth
            regularly.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; There was a public outcry at the harshness of the prison sentence, and two
            days later the governor commuted it to five years.
        </p>
        <p>When you commute between a suburb and a city, you're &ldquo;exchanging&rdquo; one
            location for another. When a chief executive substitutes a life sentence for the
            death sentence handed down by a court, he or she is commuting the original
            sentence. Most such commutations are the result of the prisoner's good
            behavior. A commutator is a device in many electric motors that regularly
            changes alternating current to direct current.</p>

        <p>immutable Not able or liable to change.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Early philosophers believed there was an immutable substance at the root of
            all existence.
        </p>
        <p>Mutable means simply &ldquo;changeable,&rdquo; so when the negative prefix im- is
            added we get its opposite. In computer programming, an immutable object is
            one that can't be changed after it's been created. In a constantly changing
            world, people who hunger for things as immutable as the laws of nature may
            try to observe an immutable moral code and set of values. Unfortunately,
            immutability isn't a basic quality of many things in this world.</p>

        <p>permutation A change in the order of a set of objects;
            rearrangement, variation.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; They had rearranged the rooms in the house plans four or five times already,
            but the architect had come up with yet another permutation.
        </p>
        <p>There are six permutations of the letters A, B, and C, selected two at a time:
            AB, AC, BC, BA, CA, and CB. As you see, order is important in
            permutations. (By contrast, there are only three combinations: AB, AC, and
            BC.) Permutation is an important concept in mathematics, especially in the
            field of probability. But we can use the word more generally to mean any
            change produced by rearranging existing parts without introducing new ones.
            Some soap operas, for example, love permutations; the cast of regulars is
            constantly being rearranged into new pairs, and even triangles.</p>

        <p>transmute (1) To change in shape, appearance, or nature,
            especially for the better; to transform. (2) To experience such a change.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Working alone in his cluttered laboratory in 15th-century Milan, he spent
            twenty years searching for a method of transmuting lead into gold.
        </p>
        <p>Transmutation changes something over into something else. Thus, a writer
            may transmute his life into stories or novels, and an arranger might transmute
            a lively march tune into a quiet lullaby. In the &ldquo;Myth of Er&rdquo; at the end of
            Plato's Republic, for example, human souls are transmuted into the body and
            existence of their choice. Having learned from their last life what they do not
            want to be, many choose transmutation into something that seems better. A
            meek man chooses to be transmuted into a tyrant, a farmer into a dashing (but
            short-lived) warrior, and so on. But very few seem to have learned anything
            from their former life that would make their choice a real improvement.</p>

        <p>FRACT comes from the Latin verb frangere, &ldquo;to break or shatter.&rdquo; A
            fraction is one of the pieces into which a whole can be broken, and a fracture
            is a break in a wall, a rock, or a bone.</p>

        <p>&bull; Shopping with a fractious child is next to impossible.
        </p>
        <p>One of the earliest meanings of fraction was &ldquo;a break in good feeling&rdquo;&mdash;that
            is, an argument or conflict. So a person who starts fights could be called
            fractious. A fractious horse is one that hasn't been properly broken or trained.
            A fractious political party is one whose members keep fighting among
            themselves. And a fractious baby is one that's always breaking the home's

        <p>fractal An irregular shape that looks much the same at any scale

        <p>&bull; He was showing her the fractals in the local ferns, in which each leaf
            reproduced the shape of the entire fern.
        </p>
        <p>This term was coined in 1975 to describe shapes that seem to exist at both the
            small-scale and large-scale levels in the same natural object. Fractals can be
            seen in snowflakes, in which the microscopic crystals that make up a flake
            look much like the flake itself. They can also be seen in tree bark and in
            broccoli buds. Coastlines often represent fractals as well, being highly
            uneven at both a large scale and a very small scale. Fractal geometry has been
            important in many fields, including astronomy, physical chemistry, and fluid

        <p>infraction The breaking of a law or a violation of another's

        <p>&bull; The assistant principal dealt with any students who had committed minor
            infractions of the rules.
        </p>
        <p>An infraction is usually the breaking of a law, rule, or agreement. So a nation
            charged with an infraction of an international treaty will usually have to pay a
            penalty. In Federal law, an infraction is even smaller than a misdemeanor,
            and the only penalty is a fine. Most of us occasionally commit infractions of
            parking laws and get ticketed; speeding tickets are usually for infractions as
            well, though they go on a permanent record and can end up costing you
            money for years to come. The closely related word infringement generally
            refers to a violation of a right or privilege; use of another's writings without
            permission, for example, may be an infringement of the copyright.</p>

        <p>refraction The change of direction of a ray of light or wave
            of energy as it passes at an angle from one substance into another in which its
            speed is different.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; From where I was standing, the refraction made it look as if her legs
            underwater were half their actual length.
        </p>
        <p>The root of refraction is seen in the notion that the path of a ray of light or
            wave of energy is &ldquo;broken&rdquo; when it is deflected or turned. The effects of
            refraction can be seen in a rainbow, which is formed when light rays passing
            into (and reflecting out of) water droplets are bent at different angles
            depending on their color, so that the light separates into bands of color. The
            amount of refraction depends on the angle and the type of matter; refraction
            can occur even when passing through different kinds of air. A mirage, such as
            you might see in the desert or over a patch of asphalt in the summer, occurs
            when light passing through warm air meets the very hot air near the surface;
            reflecting the sky, it often resembles a lake.</p>

        <p>The word telegenic, a blend of &ldquo;television&rdquo; and &ldquo;photogenic,&rdquo; first appeared
            back in the 1930s, before hardly anyone owned a TV. With the supreme
            importance of TV cameras in politics, people running for political office
            today worry about being telegenic enough to have a successful career. Even
            events have been described as telegenic; unfortunately, such events are often

        <p>teleological Showing or relating to design or purpose,

        <p>&bull; Many naturalists object to the teleological view that sees everything in
            nature as part of a grand design or plan.
        </p>
        <p>Teleology has the basic meaning &ldquo;the study of ends or purposes.&rdquo; So
            Aristotle's famous &ldquo;teleological argument&rdquo; claims that anything complex
            must have a creator, and thus that God exists. And a teleological explanation
            of evolutionary changes claims that all such changes occur for a definite
            purpose. But the type of morality called &ldquo;teleological ethics&rdquo; doesn't involve
            God at all: instead, it claims that we should judge whether an act is good or
            bad by seeing if it produces a good or bad result, even if the act involves
            harming or killing another person.</p>

        <p>telemetry The science or process of measuring such things

            distant station, and recording the measurements there.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The telemetry of the satellite had gone dead in 1999, and its fate remains a
            mystery.
        </p>
        <p>Telemetry is used to obtain data on the internal functioning of missiles,
            rockets, unmanned planes, satellites, and probes, providing data on such
            factors as position, altitude, and speed as well as conditions like temperature,
            air pressure, wind speed, and radiation. Weather forecasters rely on telemetry
            to map weather patterns. Astronauts on the space shuttle are monitored with
            telemetry that measures and transmits readings on their blood pressure,
            respiration, and heart rates. Similar kinds of telemetry are used by biologists
            to study animals in the wild and keep track of their populations and
            movements. Telemetry is also widely used in modern agriculture, often to
            regulate irrigation.</p>

            telephone lines. Since the creation of the World Wide Web in 1991, and with
            the widening access to broadband connections, telecommuting has grown to
            the point that the U.S. is now home to many millions of occasional
            telecommuters. Telecommuting can make work much easier for people with
            young children and people with disabilities, and because of its obvious
            environmental benefits and the lessening of traffic congestion, telecommuting
            is now officially encouraged by federal legislation. Still, only a fraction of
            those who could be telecommuting are actually doing so.</p>

        <p>&bull; The U.S. Postal Service issues first-day covers of each new stamp design

        <p>The first postage stamps were made available on May 1, 1840, in England,
            and it didn't take long for the hobby of stamp collecting to arise. Within a

            advertisement that she was &ldquo;desirous of covering her dressing room with

        <p>Even after fighting two wars against Britain, Americans continued to regard
            England with more fondness than perhaps any other country. For much of our
            history, Americans have sought to imitate the British in any number of ways
            &mdash;American movie stars even used to adopt British accents&mdash;and the two
            countries have long been close allies. But Britain isn't the only country
            Americans fall in love with; Francophiles (France-lovers), Germanophiles
            (Germany-lovers), and Italophiles (Italy-lovers) are also common. In the 19th
            century, Russian Slavophiles called for rejecting European culture in favor of
            homegrown Russian culture (Slavs being those who speak a Slavic language
            such as Russian or Polish). Occasionally phil- words are turned around; thus,
            someone who is philosemitic is a lover of Jewish culture.</p>

        <p>With its anthro- root (see ANTHROP), philanthropy means literally &ldquo;love of
            mankind.&rdquo; Thus, philanthropy is giving money for a purpose or cause
            benefiting people who you don't personally know. (Animals are usually
            included as well.) Individuals have often set up their own permanent
            philanthropic organizations in the form of foundations. The greatest
            American philanthropists have included Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Andrew
            Carnegie, and John D. Rockefeller, but tens of millions of us could be

        <p>To be negligent is to be neglectful. Negligence is an important legal concept;
            it's usually defined as the failure to use the care that a normally careful person
            would in a given situation. Negligence is a common claim in lawsuits
            regarding medical malpractice, auto accidents, and workplace injuries. But
            you can also be negligent about answering your e-mail, or negligent in the
            way you dress. (The original garment called a negligee was worn by women
            who had neglected to get fully dressed.) The legal meanings of negligent and
            negligence, however, tend to be the ones we most often encounter nowadays.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Abnegation plays an important part in the teachings of all the major religions.
            The founder of Buddhism was a prince who gave up all his worldly goods
            when he discovered the world of poverty that lay outside the palace gates,
            and abnegation has been a Buddhism practice ever since. Hinduism has an
            even older tradition of abnegation. Special periods of abnegation and fasting
            may even be included in a religion's yearly calendar; serious Christians give
            up some pleasure for the 40-day period of Lent, for instance, and Muslims are
            forbidden to eat during daylight hours during the month of Ramadan.</p>

        <p>negligible So small as to be neglected or disregarded.

        <p>&bull; Local weather forecasters had made it sound like the blizzard of the century,
            but the amount of snow turned out to be negligible.
        </p>
        <p>Negligible comes from the same Latin verb as neglect, so something
            negligible is literally &ldquo;neglectable.&rdquo; If an accident results in negligible
            damage to your car, you should be thankful. If two years of intense focus on

            through.
        </p>
        <p>To renege on a bet is to refuse to pay up when you lose. To renege on a
            promise of marriage, or on a deal of any kind, is to pull out. History is full of
            promises and commitments and treaties that were reneged on, such as the
            many treaties with Native Americans that American settlers and the U.S.
            government went back on over a period of almost 300 years. A synonym is
            welsh (&ldquo;He always welshes on his deals&rdquo;); however, since that word may
            have come from Welsh, meaning a native of Wales in Britain, some people

            was handed to Moses by God atop Mount Sinai. In Jewish and Christian
            tradition, the Ten Commandments are regarded as laws handed down from
            the highest authority and as the foundation of morality. They include
            commands to honor God, the Sabbath day, and one's parents, and bans on
            worshiping images, swearing, murder, adultery, theft, lying about others, and

        <p>Decathlon from deca- and athlon, &ldquo;contest,&rdquo; means &ldquo;ten contests.&rdquo; The

            were based on the skills needed in battle. The modern Olympic decathlon,
            which was born in 1912, consists of the 100-meter run, 400-meter run, 1500-
            meter run, 110-meter high hurdles, javelin throw, discus throw, shot put, pole
            vault, high jump, and long jump. The original winner was the legendary Jim
            Thorpe, who would later be judged the greatest American athlete of the 20th
            century. And ever since, the Olympic decathlon winner has been called the

        <p>decibel A unit based on a scale ranging from 0 to about 130
            used to measure the loudness of sound, with 0 indicating the least sound that
            can be heard and 130 the average level that causes pain.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; She worries about the damage that high decibel levels can cause, and
            always wears ear protection when mowing the lawn.
        </p>
        <p>The bel in decibel honors the inventor of the telephone, Alexander Graham
            Bell. Decibels work on a logarithmic scale (you may need to look up
            logarithm), so 20 decibels is 10 times as strong as 10 decibels, and 50
            decibels is 1,000 times as strong as 20 decibels. The decibel readings of some
            everyday sounds make for interesting comparisons. Whispers and rustling
            leaves usually register under 20 decibels, the average level of conversation is
            about 50 decibels, and noisy factories or office machinery may have decibel
            levels of 90 to 100. In the category of sounds between 100 and 120 decibels,
            which can eventually cause deafness, we find elevated trains, artillery&mdash;and
            rock concerts.</p>

        <p>decimate To reduce drastically or destroy most of.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Before the developments of modern medicine, diphtheria and typhoid could
            decimate the populations of entire towns and cities.
        </p>
        <p>Commanders in the Roman army took discipline seriously. Mutiny in the
            ranks was dealt with by selecting, through drawing lots, one soldier in every
            ten and making the other nine club or stone the unfortunate winner of this
            gruesome lottery to death. The dec- in decimate thus reflects this Roman
            practice, which was ordered by such well-known leaders as Crassus, Mark
            Antony, and Augustus. But over time, the word's meaning has shifted, and
            today it almost always describes great destruction or loss of life. So, for
            example, we can say that a wave of layoffs has decimated a company's
            workforce, the populations of some of Africa's greatest wild animals have
            been decimated by poaching, or aerial bombardment has decimated whole

            his version, 100&deg; marked the freezing point of water, and 0&deg; its boiling point.
            Later users found it less confusing to reverse these two. To convert
            Fahrenheit degrees to centigrade, subtract 32 and multiply by 5/9. To convert
            centigrade to Fahrenheit, multiply by 9/5 and add 32.</p>

        <p>In ancient Rome, a century was approximately equal to a company in the

            Capernaum, centurions are present at the crucifixion, and in later years St.
            Paul is arrested by centurions. According to a writer of the time, centurions
            were chosen for their size and strength, their abilities at swordplay and at
            throwing missiles, and the quality of their discipline, which was partly shown
            by how well their soldiers kept their own armor polished.</p>

        <p>NOM comes from the Latin word for &ldquo;name.&rdquo; A nominee is a person
            &ldquo;named&rdquo;&mdash;or nominated&mdash;to run for or serve in office. A binomial (&ldquo;two
            names&rdquo;) is the scientific name for a species: Felis catus for the house cat, for
            example. A polynomial, with &ldquo;many names,&rdquo; is an algebra expression
            involving several terms: 2x2 + 9y &ndash; z3, for instance.</p>

        <p>nominal (1) Existing in name or form only and not in reality.
            (2) So small as to be unimportant; insignificant.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The actor himself was the nominal author, but 90 percent of the prose was
            the work of his ghostwriter.
        </p>
        <p>Something nominal exists only in name. So the nominal ruler in a
            constitutional monarchy is the king or queen, but the real power is in the
            hands of the elected prime minister. In the United Kingdom, the British
            monarch is also the nominal head of the Church of England; and those
            baptized in the Church who aren't really churchgoers might be called nominal
            Christians. A fee can be called nominal when it's small in comparison to the
            value of what it buys. So, for example, you might sell a friend a good piece of
            furniture for a nominal amount. And the charge for a doctor's visit might be a
            nominal $20, since most of the cost is covered by an insurance plan.</p>

        <p>nomenclature (1) A name or designation, or the act
            of naming. (2) A system of terms or symbols used in biology, where New
            Latin names are given to kinds and groups of animals and plants.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Naming newly discovered plants or animals requires close study of the
            system of nomenclature.
        </p>
        <p>Various specialized fields have their own particular nomenclatures, or sets of
            terms. In particle physics, for instance, the elementary particles known as
            quarks, which are believed to come in pairs, have acquired such names as
            &ldquo;up&rdquo; and &ldquo;down,&rdquo; &ldquo;strange&rdquo; and &ldquo;charm,&rdquo; and
            &ldquo;truth&rdquo; and &ldquo;beauty&rdquo;&mdash;which
            is all most of us know about quarks and all we need to know. But
            nomenclature is used most often for the system of biological classification
            created by Linnaeus. In Linnaeus's system, each species has its own two-
            word name, the first word being the name of its genus. Thus, the genus Equus
            includes the horse (Equus caballus) and the mountain zebra (Equus zebra).
            But since broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage actually all belong to the same
            species (Brassica oleracea), they each need a third name to distinguish
            themselves.</p>

        <p>ignominious (1) Marked with shame or disgrace;

        <p>&bull; If Attila the Hun was truly murdered by his bride on their wedding night, it
            was a most ignominious death for a warrior.
        </p>
        <p>The Latin nomen could mean both &ldquo;name&rdquo; and &ldquo;good reputation,&rdquo; and even
            today we can say that someone who has been disgraced has &ldquo;lost his good
            name.&rdquo; With its negative prefix ig-, ignominious indicates the &ldquo;namelessness&rdquo;
            that goes with shame or dishonor. A person who suffers an ignominious fate
            may die nameless and forgotten. In the former Soviet Union, party leaders
            who fell out of favor, even if they avoided being imprisoned or executed,
            became nonpersons. Their names were removed from official records and
            history books and they were treated as if they had never existed.</p>

        <p>&bull; Calling the native peoples of the western hemisphere &ldquo;Indians&rdquo; was one of
            the great misnomers in recorded history.
        </p>
        <p>Historians have long noted that the Holy Roman Empire in its later years was
            neither holy, Roman, nor an empire. The Battle of Bunker Hill was actually
            fought on nearby Breed's Hill. And the famous Woodstock Festival was
            actually held in the town of Bethel. But misnomers aren't limited to history.
            The Pennsylvania Dutch are actually of German ancestry. Koala bears aren't
            bears&mdash;they're marsupials. And in the world of food, the Rocky Mountain
            oyster, as diners have sometimes discovered too late, aren't really oysters.</p>

        <p>PATER/PATR comes from both the Greek and the Latin word for &ldquo;father.&rdquo;

        <p>&bull; They passed themselves off as patricians, and no one looked too closely at
            where their money came from.
        </p>
        <p>A patrician was originally a descendant of one of the original citizen families
            of ancient Rome. Until about 350 B.C., only patricians could hold the office
            of senator, consul, or pontifex (priest). Later, the word was applied to
            members of the nobility created by the Roman emperor Constantine. As time
            went by, other nobles, such as those in medieval Italian republics and in
            German city-states, also came to be known as patricians. Today someone's
            appearance, manners, or tastes can be described as patrician, whether the
            person is actually of high birth or not. The actress Grace Kelly, an
            immigrant's daughter, was admired for her patrician beauty even before she
            became Princess Grace of Monaco, with classic features worthy of ancient
            Rome's finest sculptors.</p>

        <p>patriarchy (1) A family, group, or government controlled

            are related to each other through their fathers.

        <p>&bull; She spent the 1980s raging against the patriarchy, which she claimed had

        </p>
        <p>With its root -arch, meaning &ldquo;ruler, leader,&rdquo; a patriarch is a man who
            dominates something, even if it's just a family. In Christianity, the term is
            used for a few leading figures who appear early in the Old Testament,
            including Methuselah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; in the Eastern Orthodox
            church, a patriarch is usually the equivalent of a bishop. Outside of the field
            of anthropology, patriarchy didn't start to be used much until the 1970s,
            when the women's movement gained a huge following. Many feminists have
            claimed that all Western societies are patriarchal&mdash;that is, that they
            systematically enable men to dominate women. But there's plenty of
            disagreement about how this is done, and the word isn't discussed as often as
            it used to be.</p>

        <p>expatriate A person who has moved to a foreign land.

            wondering what had led each of them to leave America.
        </p>
        <p>Expatriate combines the prefix ex-, &ldquo;out of&rdquo; or &ldquo;away from,&rdquo; with the Latin
            patria, &ldquo;fatherland.&rdquo; A famous colony of expatriates was the group of writers
            and artists who gathered in Paris between the two world wars, including
            Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Gertrude Stein. Unlike an exile
            or an emigrant, an expatriate's residence abroad is usually voluntary and
            extended but not permanent, and expatriates&mdash;often called expats&mdash;generally
            keep their original national identity and eventually end their self-imposed
            exiles by repatriating themselves.</p>

        <p>paternalistic Tending to supply the needs of or regulate

        </p>
        <p>A good father shows paternal concern about his children, just as a good
            mother often acts out of maternal feeling. But paternalistic has a negative
            sound nowadays, since paternalistic people or institutions seek&mdash;often with
            decent intentions&mdash;to control many aspects of the lives of those under their
            control. In the 19th century, mill owners actually often provided cheap
            housing for the mill's employees. Today companies frequently have strict
            rules regarding personal appearance, or against marriages within the
            company. Colleges and universities used to practice a kind of paternalism,
            especially in trying to keep men and women out of each other's dorms, but a
            changing society has mostly put an end to that.</p>

        <p>LEGA comes from the Latin legare, meaning &ldquo;to appoint&rdquo; or &ldquo;to send as a

            the law connects with sending deputies can get awfully complicated and

            conference.
        </p>
        <p>Legate is a somewhat old-fashioned word, less used today than it was a
            century ago. More common is the synonym envoy. In the days before
            electronic communications, a legate often had particularly large
            responsibilities, since he couldn't check with his government to be sure he
            was doing the right thing. The Vatican still sends papal legates to represent

        <p>&bull; The Stradivarius family of violin makers left a priceless legacy of
            remarkable instruments.

        <p>In its basic meaning, a legacy is a gift of money or other personal property
            that's granted by the terms of a will&mdash;often a substantial gift that needs to be
            properly managed. But the word is used much more broadly as well. So, for
            instance, much of Western civilization&mdash;law, philosophy, aesthetics&mdash; could
            be called the undying legacy of ancient Greece. And the rights and
            opportunities that women enjoy today are partly the legacy of the early

            manage to ignore it for years. It may be annoying to read a newspaper article
            about a pet project and find that your own contributions have been relegated
            to a short sentence near the end.</p>

            any creatures that like to live together in flocks or herds&mdash;are called
            gregarious, and the same word is used for people who enjoy companionship

        <p>aggregate A collection or sum of units or parts.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; His lawyers realize that the aggregate of incriminating details is now
            pointing toward a conviction.
        </p>
        <p>An aggregate is often an example of something being greater than the sum of
            its parts. For instance, even if no individual element in a person's background
            would assure a criminal career, the aggregate of factors could make a life of
            crime seem unavoidable. Aggregate is often used in the phrase &ldquo;in the
            aggregate,&rdquo; as in &ldquo;Her achievements were, in the aggregate, impressive
            enough to earn her a scholarship.&rdquo; Aggregate is also an adjective, meaning
            &ldquo;total&rdquo;; so, for instance, economists often discuss aggregate demand for
            goods and services in the country's economy, just as you yourself might
            speak about your father's aggregate income from his three jobs.</p>

        <p>congregation (1) A gathering of people, especially for
            worship or religious instruction. (2) The membership of a church or temple.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; That Sunday the congregation was especially large, and the minister
            delivered one of his best sermons.
        </p>
        <p>The verb congregate may be used for spontaneous gatherings. A crowd
            quickly congregates at the scene of an accident, for example, just as cows,
            sheep, or horses tend to congregate during a storm. And under military rule,
            citizens are often forbidden to congregate on street corners or anywhere else.
            But a congregation is generally a group that has gathered for a formal
            purpose, usually in church. The Congregational Church was originally the
            church of the Puritan settlers, in which each congregation governed its own
            church independent of any higher authority.</p>

        <p>egregious Standing out, especially in a bad way; flagrant.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Many of the term papers contained egregious grammatical errors.
        </p>
        <p>Since egregious begins with a short version of ex-, meaning &ldquo;out of,&rdquo; the
            word should mean literally &ldquo;out of the herd.&rdquo; So something egregious
            possesses some quality that sets it apart from others. Originally, that
            distinguishing quality was something good, but by the 16th century the
            word's meaning had taken a U-turn and the word was being applied to things
            that were outrageously bad. This has remained the most common sense.
            Thus, an egregious fool is one who manages to outdo run-of-the-mill fools,
            and egregious rudeness sets a new standard for unpleasant salesclerks.</p>

        <p>segregate (1) To separate from others or from the general

        </p>
        <p>&bull; Some schools are experimenting with gender segregation, claiming that
            both sexes learn better in classrooms from which the other sex is absent.
        </p>
        <p>The prefix se- means &ldquo;apart,&rdquo; so when you segregate something you set it
            apart from the herd. The word typically means separating something
            undesirable from the healthy majority. During the apple harvest, damaged
            fruit is segregated from the main crop and used for cider. In prisons, hardened
            criminals are segregated from youthful offenders. Lepers used to be
            segregated from the general population because they were thought to be
            highly infectious. The opposite of segregate is often integrate, and the two
            words were in the news almost daily for decades as African-Americans
            struggled to be admitted into all-white schools and neighborhoods.</p>

        <p>FLU comes from the Latin verb fluere, &ldquo;to flow.&rdquo; So a flume is a narrow
            gorge with a stream flowing through it. A fluent speaker is one from whom
            words flow easily. Influence originally referred to an invisible fluid that was
            believed to flow from the stars and to affect the actions of humans. A
            mysterious outbreak of disease in 15th-century Italy led Italians to blame it

        <p>Affluence comes from the Latin verb affluere, &ldquo;to flow abundantly.&rdquo; Thus,
            someone or something blessed with affluence has received an incoming flood
            of riches. Since the affluent residents of suburbs often work in the central city

        <p>Effluent comes from the Latin verb effluere, &ldquo;to flow out.&rdquo; In an older
            meaning, an effluent was a stream flowing out of a river or lake. But
            nowadays effluent almost always means wastes that pour into our water and
            air. Liquid factory waste, smoke, and raw sewage can all be called effluents.

        <p>To apprehend is to seize, either physically or mentally. So to apprehend a
            thief is to nab him. But to apprehend a confusing news story, or to apprehend
            a difficult concept in physics, is to understand it&mdash;that is, to &ldquo;grasp&rdquo; it
            mentally. If you're apprehensive about something that's about to happen, it

        <p>To comprehend is to mentally grasp something's complete nature or meaning.
            Comprehend is thus often a bit stronger than understand: for example, you
            may understand the instructions in a handbook without completely
            comprehending their purpose. Comprehend's second meaning is much less
            common. Using that sense of the word, we could say that good manners
            comprehends (that is, includes) more than simple table etiquette, for example,
            or that true courage comprehends more than just physical showing off. And
            something comprehensive includes a great deal: so a comprehensive exam,

            thoroughly reprehensible.

        <p>From its prefix re-, meaning &ldquo;back,&rdquo; reprehend would mean literally &ldquo;to hold

            scold, blame&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, to restrain bad behavior by expressing
            disapproval. Reprehensible is applied to both things and people&mdash;that is, both
            the sin and the sinner. So a senator might be scolded for reprehensible
            conduct, but might also be called a thoroughly reprehensible person. And
            most of us would call dogfighting morally reprehensible, and would use the

        <p>TEMPER comes from the Latin verb temperare, &ldquo;to moderate or keep

            zone&mdash;that is, the zone where the temperature is moderate, between the hot
            tropics and the icy Arctic and Antarctic Circles. It's less easy to see how we
            get temperature from this root; the word actually used to refer to the mixing
            of different basic elements in the body, and only slowly came to mean how
            hot or cold that body was.</p>

        <p>The temper root keeps its basic meaning&mdash;&ldquo;to mix&rdquo; or &ldquo;to keep within

            it with some balancing quality or substance so as to avoid anything extreme.
            Thus, it's often said that a judge must temper justice with mercy. Young
            people only gradually learn to temper their natural enthusiasms with caution.

        <p>Since temperance means basically &ldquo;moderation,&rdquo; you might assume that,
            with respect to alcohol, temperance would mean moderate consumption, or
            &ldquo;social drinking.&rdquo; Instead, the word has usually meant the prohibition of all
            alcohol. To temperance leaders such as Carry Nation, the safest form of
            drinking was no alcohol at all. Believing she was upholding the law, Nation
            began her hatchet-swinging attacks on saloons, known as &ldquo;hatchetations,&rdquo; in

        <p>intemperate Not moderate or mild; excessive, extreme.

        <p>&bull; Lovers of fine wines and scotches are almost never intemperate drinkers.
        </p>
        <p>Since the prefix in- generally means &ldquo;not,&rdquo; intemperate is the opposite of
            temperate. Someone intemperate rejects moderation in favor of excess. A
            religious fanatic is likely to preach with intemperate zeal, and a mean theater
            critic may become intemperate in her criticism of a new play, filling her
            review with intemperate language. And both temperate and intemperate also
            often refer to weather; a region with an intemperate climate isn't where all of
            us would choose to build a house.</p>

        <p>distemper (1) A highly contagious viral disease, especially

            cats, marked by the destruction of white blood cells.

        <p>&bull; An epidemic of feline distemper had swept the country, and its cat
            population had plummeted.
        </p>
        <p>Back when doctors believed that our moods were affected by an imbalance of
            mysterious fluids in the body, or &ldquo;humors,&rdquo; distemper often meant
            moodiness, as when Shakespeare's Hamlet is asked &ldquo;What is the source of
            your distemper?&rdquo; Today the word is used only for true physical conditions.
            The distemper that affects dogs, often called canine distemper, also affects
            foxes, wolves, mink, raccoons, and ferrets. It can be treated with medication,
            but is generally fatal if not treated. Distemper in cats, known as feline
            distemper or panleukopenia, actually isn't related to canine distemper. If
            caught quickly, it too can be treated. And both types can be prevented by
            vaccination, so all responsible pet owners get their animals vaccinated.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In some cultures, a ritual bath or prayer is performed to purge guilt or evil
            spirits. The Minoans of ancient Crete may have used human sacrifice as a
            way of purging the entire community, which is fine for the community but
            rough on the victims. In many cultures, people periodically purge themselves
            physically&mdash;that is, clean out their digestive tracts&mdash;by taking strong
            laxatives; this used to be a popular springtime ritual, and herbal purgatives
            were readily available.</p>

        <p>expurgate To cleanse of something morally harmful or
            offensive; to remove objectionable parts from.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In those years, high-school English classes only used expurgated editions of
            Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.
        </p>
        <p>Expurgation has a long and questionable history. Perhaps history's most
            famous expurgator, or censor, was the English editor Thomas Bowdler, who
            in 1818 published the Family Shakespeare, an expurgated edition of
            Shakespeare's plays that omitted or changed any passages that, in Bowdler's
            opinion, couldn't decently be read aloud in a family. As a result, the term
            bowdlerize is now a synonym of expurgate.</p>

        <p>purgative (1) Cleansing or purifying, especially from sin. (2)

        <p>&bull; I'm afraid my ten-year-old discovered the purgative effect of too many
            apples after a lazy afternoon in the orchard.
        </p>
        <p>Purgative can be used as a noun as well as an adjective. For centuries,
            doctors prescribed purgatives&mdash;that is, laxatives&mdash;for all kinds of ailments,
            not knowing anything better to do. Physical cleansing has always reminded
            people of emotional and spiritual cleansing, as expressed in the saying
            &ldquo;Cleanliness is next to godliness.&rdquo; So we may say, for example, that
            confession has a purgative effect on the soul. Some psychologists used to
            claim that expressing your anger is purgative; but in fact it may generally be
            no better for your emotional life than taking a laxative, and can sometimes
            really foul things up.</p>

        <p>purgatory (1) According to Roman Catholic doctrine, the
            place where the souls of those who have died in God's grace must pay for
            their sins through suffering before ascending to heaven. (2) A place or state

        <p>Purgatory is the place where the soul is cleansed of all impurities, as Dante
            described in his great poem The Divine Comedy. Today purgatory can refer
            to any place or situation in which suffering and misery are felt to be sharp but
            temporary. Waiting to hear the results of a test, or whether you got a good
            job, can be a purgatory. And an endless after-dinner speech can make an
            entire roomful of people feel as if they're in purgatory.</p>

        <p>MILL means either &ldquo;a thousand&rdquo; or &ldquo;a thousandth.&rdquo; A millennium is a
            thousand years, and a million is a thousand thousands. But a milligram is a

        <p>millefleur Having a pattern of small flowers and plants all over.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; She was painstakingly embroidering a millefleur pattern on a pillow casing.
        </p>
        <p>Millefleur came into French from the Latin mille florae (&ldquo;a thousand
            flowers&rdquo;), and from French directly into English. You may have seen the
            famed Unicorn Tapestries, in which the unicorn is seen frolicking, relaxing,
            being hunted, and being caught, all against a beautiful millefleur background.
            Italian has given us the similar word millefiori; though fiori, like fleurs,
            means &ldquo;flowers,&rdquo; millefiori actually refers to a type of multicolored
            ornamental glass. And the borrowed French word mille-feuille (feuille
            meaning &ldquo;leaf&rdquo;) is the name of a dish made with puff pastry, the kind of
            pastry whose flakes resemble thin dry leaves.</p>

        <p>millenarianism (1) Belief in the 1,000-year era

        </p>
        <p>&bull; Millenarianism is one of the future-oriented beliefs common in the New
            Age movement.
        </p>
        <p>Originally the millennium was not simply any thousand-year period, but
            instead the thousand years prophesied in the biblical Book of Revelation,
            when holiness will prevail on earth and Jesus Christ will preside over all.
            Later, millennium was extended to mean any period&mdash;always in the future&mdash;
            marked by universal happiness and human perfection. On several occasions
            over the centuries, members of Christian sects have become convinced that
            the biblical millennium was arriving and gathered together to await it. But
            nonreligious millenarians have also believed in a future society marked by
            human perfection. Even if they regard this future as certain, they've generally
            been willing to help it along by working for a political, social, or economic
            revolution. The millennium always seems to be approaching; to date, it hasn't

            poisonous to their enemies. If their structure were true to their name,
            millipedes would have a thousand legs, but in fact they have far fewer. Even
            so, a millipede in motion is a sight to ponder: How can it possibly coordinate
            all those legs so that it doesn't trip over itself? Like some tiny conga line or

        <p>A semitone (sometimes called a half tone or a half step) is the distance from a

            intervals that are used intentionally in almost any of the music you'll

        <p>SUB means &ldquo;under.&rdquo; So a subway runs under the streets, and a submarine
            moves under the ocean's surface. A subject is a person under the authority of
            another. A movie's subplot is lower in importance than the main plot.
            Subscribe once meant &ldquo;to write one's name underneath,&rdquo; so subscription was

            some kind of subconscious agitation behind her case of butterfingers.
        </p>
        <p>We're rarely aware, or at least fully aware, of our subconscious mental
            activity. But subconscious thought does affect our feelings and behavior, and
            it's often revealed in dreams, artistic expression, and slips of the tongue. The
            subconscious mind can be a hiding place for anxiety, a source of creativity,
            and often the reason behind our own mysterious behavior.</p>

        <p>subjugate To bring under control and rule as a subject;

        </p>
        <p>&bull; The country's government claimed it was just trying to protect national
            security, but some saw its actions as an attempt to subjugate the news media.
        </p>
        <p>Since jugus means &ldquo;yoke&rdquo; in Latin, subjugate means literally &ldquo;bring under
            the yoke.&rdquo; Farmers control oxen by means of a heavy wooden yoke over their
            shoulders. In ancient Rome, conquered soldiers, stripped of their uniforms,
            might actually be forced to pass under an ox yoke as a sign of submission to
            the Roman victors. Even without an actual yoke, what happens to a
            population that has come under the control of another can be every bit as
            humiliating. In dozens of countries throughout the world, ethnic minorities
            are denied basic rights and view themselves as subjugated by their country's
            government, army, and police.</p>

        <p>subliminal Not quite strong enough to be sensed or

        </p>
        <p>&bull; A few worried parents claimed that some heavy-metal songs contain
            subliminal messages&mdash;in the form of words recorded backwards&mdash;that urge
            young fans to take up devil worship.
        </p>
        <p>Since the Latin word limen means &ldquo;threshold,&rdquo; something subliminal exists
            just below the threshold of conscious awareness. The classic example of a
            subliminal message is &ldquo;Eat popcorn&rdquo; flashed on a movie screen so quickly
            that the audience doesn't even notice it consciously. Actually, no such
            advertising has ever been shown to work. But ordinary ads, both in print and
            on TV, do contain all kinds of images that shape our response to the product
            being advertised even when we don't realize it. Try looking carefully at some
            ads that you like, in order to discover how many ways they may be
            subliminally affecting you.</p>

        <p>subversion (1) An attempt to overthrow a government by
            working secretly from within. (2) The corrupting of someone or something
            by weakening their morals, loyalty, or faith.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; It's sometimes easier for a government to combat attack from outside than
            subversion from within.
        </p>
        <p>Subversion is literally the &ldquo;turning over&rdquo; of something. In the 1950s and '60s,
            many people worried about communist subversion of the U.S. government,
            though they often saw subversive activities where none existed.
            Nondemocratic governments often claim that anyone who disagrees with
            them or joins a demonstration is a subversive. But subversion isn't always
            quite so serious a matter; when words like weekend, sandwich, job, and
            camping started being used by the French, for example, some of them began
            claiming that America was subverting their language.</p>

        <p>HYPER is a Greek prefix that means &ldquo;above or beyond,&rdquo; so hyper- often
            means about the same thing as super-. Hyperinflation is inflation that's
            growing at a very high rate. To be hypercritical or hypersensitive is to be
            critical or sensitive beyond the normal. And if you hyperextend a knee or
            elbow, it means you're actually bending it backward.</p>

        <p>hyperactive Excessively active.

        <p>&bull; Stephen King's hyperactive imagination has produced dozens of fantastical
            stories, not to mention countless nightmares in his readers.
        </p>
        <p>For doctors and psychologists, hyperactive describes a condition with
            unpleasant consequences. Hyperactive children usually have a very short
            attention span and can't sit still, and hyperactivity can lead to difficulty in
            learning or just get them in trouble for disturbing their classes. But not every
            high-spirited child is hyperactive. Having a high energy level is pretty normal
            for children, and some parents think that prescribing drugs for hyperactivity
            is mostly just good for the drug companies.</p>

            the restaurant critics.
        </p>
        <p>Advertisers and sports commentators make their living by their skillful use of
            hyperbole. Presenting each year's Superbowl as &ldquo;the greatest contest in the
            history of sports&rdquo; certainly qualifies as hyperbole, especially since the final
            scores are usually so lopsided. Equally hyperbolic are advertisers' claims that
            this year's new car model is &ldquo;the revolutionary vehicle you've been waiting
            for&rdquo; when it's barely different from last year's&mdash;which of course was once
            described in the same glowing terms. Politicians love hyperbole too; some of
            them seem convinced that calling a new bill &ldquo;the worst bill ever passed by
            Congress&rdquo; or comparing the president to Hitler is a great way to win votes.</p>

        <p>hypertension High blood pressure.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Pregnancy is often accompanied by mild hypertension that doesn't threaten
            the mother's life.
        </p>
        <p>You might have thought that hypertension was what a movie audience feels
            near the climax of a thriller, but you would have been wrong. High blood
            pressure&mdash;that is high pressure against the walls of your veins and arteries
            caused by blood flow&mdash;often occurs when the arteries or veins become
            blocked or narrowed, making the heart work harder to pump blood. But many
            cases seem to be the result of smoking or taking in too much salt, and many
            are genetically caused. Hypertension is serious, since it can lead to heart
            attacks and strokes. Though it often produces no warning symptoms, your
            blood pressure can be checked quickly and easily by a nurse. If it's high, it
            can usually be controlled by stopping smoking, losing weight, lowering your
            salt intake, and exercising&mdash;and if all else fails, by medication.</p>

        <p>hyperventilate To breathe rapidly and deeply.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; They laughed so hard they began to hyperventilate and feel giddy.
        </p>
        <p>Hyperventilating can be a response to fear and anxiety. A test pilot who
            panics and hyperventilates faces a dangerous situation. When the level of
            carbon dioxide in your blood goes down and the oxygen level goes up, blood
            vessels constrict because of the chemical changes and the body can't get
            enough oxygen (even though it's there in the blood), and the pilot can become
            lightheaded and may even faint. To guard against this, pilots are taught to
            control their breathing. On the ground, the usual remedy for hyperventilation
            is breathing into a paper bag, which raises the level of carbon dioxide and
            restores normal breathing.</p>

        <p>precocious Showing the qualities or abilities of an adult at

        <p>&bull; Everyone agrees that their seven-year-old daughter is smart and precocious,

        </p>
        <p>Growing from a child to an adult is like the slow ripening of fruit, and that's
            the image that gave us precocious. The word is based on the Latin verb
            coquere, meaning &ldquo;to ripen&rdquo; or &ldquo;to cook,&rdquo; but it comes most directly from the
            adjective praecox, which means &ldquo;ripening early or before its time.&rdquo; Precocity
            can occasionally be annoying; but precocious children don't come precooked,

        <p>&bull; Growing up in a house full of sisters had predisposed her to find her
            friendships with other women.
        </p>
        <p>Predispose usually means putting someone in a frame of mind to be willing
            to do something. So a longtime belief in the essential goodness of people, for
            example, will predispose us to trust a stranger. Teachers know that coming
            from a stable family generally predisposes children to learn. And viewing
            television violence for years may leave young people with a predisposition to
            accept real violence as normal. The medical sense of the word is similar.
            Thus, a person's genes may predispose her to diabetes or arthritis, and

            (rather than replace it). We paraphrase all the time. When you tell a friend
            what someone else has said, you're almost always paraphrasing, since you're
            not repeating the exact words. If you go to hear a talk, you might paraphrase
            the speaker's main points afterward for your friends. And when writing a
            paper on a short story, you might start off your essay with a paraphrase of
            the plot. Paraphrasing is especially useful when dealing with poetry, since
            poetic language is often difficult and poems may have meanings that are hard
            to pin down.</p>

        <p>paralegal Of, relating to, or being a trained assistant to a
            lawyer.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Part of the firm's business involved researching real-estate properties, which
            the senior lawyers regarded as paralegal work.
        </p>
        <p>Much of the work in a law office can be done by paralegal assistants, also
            called legal aides or simply paralegals, who work alongside licensed
            lawyers. Often a paralegal is trained in a narrow field and then entrusted with
            it. In this respect, paralegals are similar to paraprofessionals in other fields,
            such as engineering. Paraprofessionals used to be trained in the office itself,
            but today it's common to study for a paraprofessional certificate or degree at a
            community college or university.</p>

        <p>paramedic A specially trained medical technician licensed

            to a hospital.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Five ambulances had already arrived, and a dozen paramedics were
            crouched over the victims with bandages and IVs.
        </p>
        <p>In ground warfare, wounded troops must usually be transported from the
            front lines back to field hospitals, and trained paramedical personnel&mdash;that
            is, nondoctors, usually known as medics or corpsmen&mdash;were first widely used
            in such situations. It took many decades for the wartime model to be applied
            effectively to ordinary peacetime medicine. With advances in medical
            technology (such as defibrillators, for restarting a heart after a heart attack),
            paramedics became an essential part of emergency medicine, and today
            hundreds of thousands of people owe their lives to paramedics.
            Paraprofessionals who work only in hospitals and clinics usually go by other

        <p>paramilitary Relating to a force formed on a military
            pattern, especially as a possible backup military force.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In the country's most remote regions, the real power was held by large
            landowners, who actually kept paramilitary forces, their own private armies,
            on their estates.
        </p>
        <p>This term paramilitary can take in a wide range of organizations, but is
            usually applied to forces formed by a government. Groups opposing a
            government, even when organized along military lines, are more often
            referred to as guerrillas or insurgents. In countries with weak central
            governments (such as, in recent times, Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, or Congo),
            warlords may form their own paramilitary forces and take over all local
            police and military functions. Paramilitary often has a sinister sound today,
            since it's also applied to groups of off-duty military or police personnel who
            carry out illegal violence, often at night, with the quiet support of a
            government.</p>

        <p>Metadata is electronic data that somehow describes an electronic file or its
            contents, and is usually included in the file itself. An important use for
            metadata is for searching. A piece of metadata might identify the file, its size,
            the date it was compiled, its nature, and so on. Metadata is particularly
            important for making pictures searchable; since a picture of a landscape in the
            Southwest, for example, can't be &ldquo;read&rdquo; by a search engine, data tags such as
            &ldquo;Southwest,&rdquo; &ldquo;mesa,&rdquo; and &ldquo;arroyo&rdquo; might be included in the digitized
            image
            file. The same can be done for audio files; the tags for a speech might read
            &ldquo;Gore,&rdquo; &ldquo;climate,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Copenhagen.&rdquo; Metadata tags for a Web page,
            including tags identifying its most important content, ensure that the page

        <p>metaphorical Relating to a figure of speech in which a
            word or phrase meaning one kind of object or idea is used in place of another
            to suggest a similarity between them.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; He always points out to his classes that metaphors can be found in poetry of
            all kinds, from &ldquo;The eyes are the windows of the soul&rdquo; to &ldquo;You ain't nothin'
            but a hound dog.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>Metaphor comes from a Greek word meaning &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; (or, to stay close to
            its roots, &ldquo;carry beyond&rdquo;). Thus, a metaphor transfers the meaning of one
            word or phrase to another. Metaphors often include a form of the verb be (as
            in the examples above), and they're often contrasted with similes, which are
            usually introduced by like or as (&ldquo;O, my luve's like a red, red rose&rdquo;). But,
            they don't have to include be; when you say that the teacher gave us a
            mountain of homework or that we're drowning in paperwork, these too are
            metaphorical statements.</p>

            and they get restless when his sermons head in the direction of metaphysics.
        </p>
        <p>Just as physics deals with the laws that govern the physical world (such as
            those of gravity or the properties of waves), metaphysics describes what is
            beyond physics&mdash;the nature and origin of reality itself, the immortal soul, and
            the existence of a supreme being. Opinions about these metaphysical topics
            vary widely, since what's being discussed can't be observed or measured or
            even truly known to exist. So most metaphysical questions are still as far
            from a final answer as they were when Plato and Aristotle were asking them.</p>

        <p>metonymy A figure of speech in which the name of one
            thing is used for the name of something else that is associated with it or
            related to it.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; When Wall Street has the jitters, the White House issues a statement, and
            the people wait for answers from City Hall, metonymy is having a busy day.
        </p>
        <p>At first glance, metaphor and metonymy seem close in meaning, but there are
            differences. In a metaphor we substitute one thing for something else that's
            usually quite different; for example, Web for a worldwide network of linked
            computers and their technology. In metonymy, we replace one word or
            phrase (such as &ldquo;stock market&rdquo; or &ldquo;local government officials&rdquo; in the
            examples above) with another word or phrase associated with it. Most
            familiar metonyms are place-names, such as Hollywood for &ldquo;the film
            industry,&rdquo; or K Street for &ldquo;Washington lobbyists.&rdquo; But saying &ldquo;the press&rdquo; to
            refer to the news media, or &ldquo;sweat&rdquo; to refer to hard work, could also be called

        <p>percolate (1) To trickle or filter through something porous. (2)

        </p>
        <p>&bull; She tells herself that the money she spends on luxuries eventually percolates
            down to the needy.
        </p>
        <p>Percolate comes from a Latin verb meaning &ldquo;to put through a sieve.&rdquo;
            Something that percolates filters through something else, just as small
            particles pass through a sieve. Water is drawn downward through the soil,
            and this percolation usually cleans the water. A slow rain is ideal for
            percolating into the soil, since in a violent rainstorm most of it quickly runs
            off. For this reason, drip irrigation is the most effective and water-conserving
            form of irrigation. Percolation isn't always a physical process; awareness of
            an issue may percolate slowly into the minds of the public, just as Spanish
            words may gradually percolate into English, often starting in the Southwest.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Pervade can be used to describe something physical: a chemical odor may
            pervade a building, for example, and most scientists believe that outer space
            is pervaded by mysterious &ldquo;dark matter.&rdquo; But the word usually doesn't refer
            to anything that could be detected by scientific instruments. Thus, humor may
            pervade a novel, gloom may pervade a gathering, and corruption may
            pervade a government. And something pervasive exists in every part of
            something: fatherlessness may be a pervasive problem in poor
            neighborhoods, for instance, and pervasive optimism sometimes causes the
            stock market to soar.</p>

        <p>&bull; On Saturday mornings back in those days, the aroma of fresh pies and
            breads would permeate almost every house on the block.
        </p>
        <p>Permeate is often a synonym for pervade. We could say, for example, that at
            exam time the campus is either &ldquo;permeated&rdquo; or &ldquo;pervaded&rdquo; by a sense of
            dread. But the two words aren't identical. For one thing, permeate can mean
            simply &ldquo;pass through,&rdquo; and is often used when talking about liquids; thus, a
            boot can be permeated by water, though certain oils make leather less
            permeable, and you might just want to buy boots made of impermeable
            material. And things may &ldquo;pass through&rdquo; in a nonphysical way as well; so
            you might say that anxiety about climate change has started to permeate into
            the public's consciousness&mdash;but once anxiety has become pervasive it's pretty
            much taken over.</p>

        <p>An antibody is a protein produced by your immune system to fight outside
            invaders. Since the enemy substance actually triggers the production of
            antibodies, such substances are called antigens&mdash;anti- being short for
            antibody, and -gen meaning &ldquo;producer.&rdquo; (In a similar way, an allergen
            produces an allergy, and a pathogen produces a pathology or disease.)
            Antigens are often rodlike structures that stick out from the surface of an
            invading organism&mdash;usually a bacterium or a virus&mdash;and allow it to attach
            itself to cells in the invaded body. But unfortunately for them, in doing so
            they let the immune system know they're present, and the body is flooded
            with an army of Pac-Man-like antibodies.</p>

        <p>antipathy A strong dislike.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; It seemed odd that he could feel such intense antipathy for someone he'd
            only met once, and we suspected there was more to the story.
        </p>
        <p>When the nation of Yugoslavia was created in 1945, it combined a number of
            ethnic groups with a history of violent antipathy toward each other. In 1991&ndash;
            92 four regions of the country announced that they would become
            independent nations; a bloody six-year war followed, fueled by these ancient
            and powerful antipathies. The American Civil War similarly resulted from
            antipathy between the North and the South. But in the U.S.'s relations with its
            next-door neighbors, it's been a long time since emotions have gotten much
            stronger than annoyance.</p>

        <p>antithesis (1) The contrast or opposition of ideas. (2) The
            exact opposite.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Life on the small college campus, with its personal freedom and
            responsibility, was the antithesis of what many students had known in high
            school.
        </p>
        <p>Writers and speechmakers use the traditional pattern known as antithesis for
            its resounding effect; John Kennedy's famous &ldquo;ask not what your country can
            do for you&mdash;ask what you can do for your country&rdquo; is an example. But
            antithesis normally means simply &ldquo;opposite.&rdquo; Thus, war is the antithesis of
            peace, wealth is the antithesis of poverty, and love is the antithesis of hate.
            Holding two antithetical ideas in one's head at the same time&mdash;for example,
            that you're the sole master of your fate but also the helpless victim of your
            terrible upbringing&mdash;is so common as to be almost normal.</p>

            that it's
            compared to. And contrapuntal music, as in the music of Bach, sets one

        <p>&bull; Late at night he would go driving through the desert on the interstate,
            peddling his contraband to wary gas-station attendants.
        </p>
        <p>In Latin a bannus was an order or decree, so a contrabannum was something
            that went against a decree. This led to the Italian word contrabbando, from
            which we get contraband. Contraband items aren't always illegal; they may
            simply be things (such as cigarettes) that are meant to be taxed. So a dealer in
            untaxed contraband can charge a little less and still make enormous profits.
            Of course, if the item is actually forbidden, like illegal drugs, then the profits
            could be much greater.</p>

        <p>contraindication Something (such as a

        </p>
        <p>&bull; A history of stomach ulcers is a contraindication to regular use of aspirin.
        </p>
        <p>For doctors, an indication is a symptom or circumstance that makes a
            particular medical treatment desirable. Serious anxiety, for example, is often
            an indication for prescribing a tranquilizer. A contraindication, then, is a
            symptom or condition that makes a treatment risky, such as taking certain
            other medications at the same time. Drugs and conditions that are
            contraindicated for a medication are listed on its label, and reeled off at high
            speed in TV ads. Patients can guard against the dangers of drug interaction by
            reading labels carefully and making sure their doctors know what else they're

        <p>&bull; The power company was found to be contravening state and federal

        <p>Contravene is most often used in reference to laws. So a government may
            take a company to court claiming that its policies are in contravention of
            national labor laws. The contravention of copyright laws is a big topic today
            especially where electronic information is involved. And a country might be

        </p>
        <p>&bull; My father was basically a contrarian, who never accepted the common

        </p>
        <p>Anyone who thinks that most of what the public believes is wrong would be
            called a contrarian. And contrarian is a basic term in the vocabulary of
            investing. In fact, most successful investors often behave like contrarians by
            &ldquo;buying low and selling high&rdquo;&mdash;that is, buying stocks that are cheap because
            most investors put a low value on them but that have the possibility of rising,
            and selling stocks that most investors are valuing highly but that seem likely
            to decline. The word may be most common as an adjective; so you may
            express a contrarian opinion, hold a contrarian view, or pursue a contrarian
            investment strategy.</p>

            a Puritan tombstone will often display a memento mori intended for the
            living. These death's-heads or skulls may strike us as ghoulish, but they

            punishment. In earlier centuries, an educated European might place an actual

        <p>habeas corpus An order to bring a jailed person

        </p>
        <p>&bull; The country has a primitive legal system with no right of habeas corpus, and
            suspects often are shot before they ever see a judge.
        </p>
        <p>The literal meaning of habeas corpus is &ldquo;You shall have the body&rdquo;&mdash;that is,
            the judge must have the person charged with a crime brought into the
            courtroom to hear what he's been charged with. Through much of human
            history, and in many countries still today, a person may be imprisoned on the

            ever getting a chance to defend himself, or even knowing what he's done
            wrong. In England, the right to be brought before a judge to hear the charges
            and answer them was written into law over 300 years ago, and the U.S.

        <p>Rigor mortis, which translates from Latin as &ldquo;stiffness of death,&rdquo; sets in

        </p>
        <p>ACER/ACR comes from the Latin adjective acer, meaning &ldquo;sharp&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;sour.&rdquo; Grapefruit and limes have an acid taste; acid can also describe a
            person's sense of humor (other words for it might be sharp or biting). The
            acidity of the soil often indicates whether it's good for growing certain crops;
            blueberries, for instance, love acid soil, so they're more likely to be found
            east of the Mississippi River, where acid soil is the rule.</p>

        <p>acerbic Sharp or biting in temper, mood, or tone.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; She had enjoyed his acerbic humor for years, but then a friend told her
            about the nasty jokes he was making about her behind her back.
        </p>
        <p>Acerbic often describes wit. An acerbic critic won't make many friends
            among the writers or artists whose work is being criticized, but often keeps
            his or her readers amused and entertained. Acerbity may be slightly less sharp
            than sarcasm, but not much; both words have roots meaning basically &ldquo;cut.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>acrid Unpleasantly sharp and harsh; bitter.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The acrid odor of gunpowder hung in the air long after the shots' echoes had
            died away.
        </p>
        <p>Acrid exactly fits the smoke from a fire&mdash;a burning building or forest, for
            example. Dense smog may cast an acrid pall over a city, making throats burn
            and eyes sting. But, like acid and acerbic, acrid sometimes also describes
            nonphysical things, such as the remarks of a bitter person.</p>

        <p>acrimony Harsh or bitter sharpness in words, manner, or

        </p>
        <p>&bull; Town meetings here were usually civilized, and no one could recall an issue
            that had ever aroused such intense acrimony as the new pulp mill.
        </p>
        <p>Acrimony is angry harshness that usually springs from intense personal
            dislike. An acrimonious exchange is full of cutting, unpleasant remarks
            designed to hurt. Civil wars are often more acrimonious and bloody than
            foreign wars. In the same way, a bad divorce may be more acrimonious than
            any other kind of legal battle.</p>

        <p>exacerbate To make worse, more violent, or more severe.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The increase in coal-burning power plants has greatly exacerbated the
            buildup of greenhouse gases.
        </p>
        <p>To exacerbate is not to cause, but only to make something bad even worse.
            So the loss of a major industry in a city may exacerbate its already serious
            unemployment problem. A vicious remark can exacerbate a quarrel. Building
            a new mall may exacerbate an area's existing traffic problems. A new drug
            can exacerbate the side effects of the drug a patient is already taking. It used
            to be thought that too much blood in the body exacerbated a fever, so the
            patient's blood would be drained, often by means of leeches&mdash;and not all
            patients survived.</p>

        <p>STRICT comes from the Latin verb meaning &ldquo;to draw tight, bind, or tie.&rdquo; So
            the English word strict means &ldquo;tightly controlled.&rdquo; And when someone
            begins a sentence &ldquo;Strictly speaking, . . .&rdquo; you know he or she is going to be
            talking about a word or idea in its most limited sense, &ldquo;drawing tight&rdquo; the
            meaning till it's as narrow as possible.</p>
        <p />

        <p />
        <p>stricture (1) A law or rule that limits or controls something;
            restriction. (2) A strong criticism.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; There are severe legal strictures on the selling of marijuana in almost every
            state.
        </p>
        <p>Stricture has meant many things through the centuries, and its &ldquo;restriction&rdquo;
            meaning&mdash;probably the most common one today&mdash;is actually the most
            recent. High-school teachers often put strictures on texting during class.
            Cities concerned about their murder rate have slapped strictures on the
            possession of handguns. And the United Nations may vote to put strictures on
            arms sales to a country that keeps violating international treaties. With the
            meaning &ldquo;strong criticism,&rdquo; stricture is slightly old-fashioned today, but it's
            still used by intellectuals. So, for example, an article may amount to a harsh
            stricture on the whole medical profession, or an art review may just express
            the critic's strictures on sentimental paintings of cute little houses with
            glowing windows.</p>

        <p>restrictive (1) Serving or likely to keep within bounds. (2)
            Serving or tending to place under limits as to use.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The deed to the property had a restrictive covenant forbidding any
            development of the land for 50 years.
        </p>
        <p>Restrictive covenants (that is, agreements) in real-estate deeds were once
            used to forbid the buyer from ever selling the property to anyone of another
            race. These are now illegal, though other kinds of restrictive covenants are
            very common; in some neighborhoods, they may even tell you what colors
            you can't paint your house. In grammar, a restrictive clause is one that limits
            the meaning of something that comes before it. In the sentence &ldquo;That's the
            professor who I'm trying to avoid,&rdquo; &ldquo;who I'm trying to avoid&rdquo; is a restrictive
            clause, since it's what identifies the professor. But in the sentence &ldquo;That's my
            History professor, who I'm trying to avoid,&rdquo; the same clause is nonrestrictive,
            since the professor has already been identified as &ldquo;my History professor.&rdquo;
            There should always be a comma before a nonrestrictive clause, but not
            before a restrictive clause.</p>

        <p>Arteries constricted by cholesterol slow the flow of blood, just as traffic
            arteries or highways constricted by accidents slow the flow of traffic. But
            constriction isn't always physical. Economic growth may be constricted by
            trade barriers. A narrow, constricted life may be the result of poverty or lack
            of opportunity. And an actress may feel constricted by a role she played as a
            child or by her TV character from years ago, which the public refuses to
            forget.</p>

        <p>vasoconstrictor Something such as a nerve fiber or

            bleeding to a minimum.
        </p>
        <p>Our blood vessels are constantly narrowing and widening in response to our
            activity or our environment, constricting in order to retain body heat and
            widening to get rid of excess heat. So when we're hot our skin flushes, and
            when we're very cold we become pale. Since the width of the blood vessels
            affects blood pressure, vasoconstrictors are prescribed to treat low blood
            pressure. Vasoconstrictors include antihistamines and amphetamines, as well
            as nicotine and caffeine; we commonly buy them for our runny noses and
            bloodshot eyes as well. The opposite of vasoconstrictors are vasodilators,
            which are commonly used to treat high blood pressure.</p>

        <p>STRU/STRUCT comes from the Latin verb struere, meaning &ldquo;to put

            that is, built or put together. Instructions tell how the pieces should be

        <p>deconstruction Analysis of texts, works of art, and
            cultural patterns that is intended to expose the assumptions on which they are
            based, especially by exposing the limitations of language.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Deconstruction has been performed on Huckleberry Finn by English
            professors so many times that it's a wonder there's anything left of it.
        </p>
        <p>Deconstruction doesn't actually mean &ldquo;demolition&rdquo;; instead it means
            &ldquo;breaking down&rdquo; or analyzing something (especially the words in a work of
            fiction or nonfiction) to discover its true significance, which is supposedly
            almost never exactly what the author intended. A feminist may deconstruct
            an old novel to show how even an innocent-seeming story somehow depends
            on the oppression of women. A new western may deconstruct the myths of
            the old West and show lawmen as vicious and criminals as flawed but decent.
            Table manners, The Sound of Music, and cosmetics ads have all been the
            subjects of deconstructionist analysis. Of course, not everyone agrees with
            deconstructionist interpretations, and some people reject the whole idea of
            deconstruction, but most of us have run into it by now even if we didn't
            realize it.</p>

        <p>Construe can usually be translated as &ldquo;interpret.&rdquo; It's often used in law; thus,
            an Attorney General might construe the term &ldquo;serious injury&rdquo; in a child-abuse

            &ldquo;heirs&rdquo; to include spouses. The IRS's construal of some of your activities

        <p>An instrument is a tool, something used to construct. It's often a tool for
            making music. A musical saw happens to be a carpenter's tool that can be
            played with a violin bow (though you probably wouldn't want to play a
            wrench or a pair of pliers). The musical meanings of instrumental, as in &ldquo;It
            starts with an instrumental piece&rdquo; or &ldquo;a jazz instrumental,&rdquo; are common. But
            the meanings &ldquo;helpful,&rdquo; &ldquo;useful,&rdquo; and &ldquo;essential,&rdquo; as in &ldquo;He was
            instrumental
            in getting my book published,&rdquo; are just as common.</p>

        <p>PROP/PROPRI comes from the Latin word proprius, meaning &ldquo;own.&rdquo; A
            proprietor is an owner, and property is what he or she owns. And the original
            meaning of proper was &ldquo;belonging to oneself,&rdquo; so a writer around the year
            1400 could say &ldquo;With his own proper sword he was slain,&rdquo; even if we might
            not say it quite the same way today.</p>

        <p>proprietary (1) Relating to an owner or proprietor; made

        </p>
        <p>A proprietary process is a manufacturing process that others are forbidden to
            use, and a proprietary trademark is a name that only the owner can use. Legal
            rights of this kind are ensured by copyrights and patents. After a certain
            period of time, inventions and processes lose their legal protection, cease to
            be proprietary, and enter the &ldquo;public domain,&rdquo; meaning that everyone can use
            them freely. Baseball fans often take a proprietary attitude toward their
            favorite team&mdash;that is, they behave more or less as if they own it, even
            though the only thing they may own is the right to yell from a bleacher seat

            between the sexes.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Propriety used to forbid a young unmarried man and woman to go almost
            anywhere without an adult.
        </p>
        <p>In an earlier era, when social manners were far more elaborate than they are
            today, propriety and impropriety were words in constant use. Today we're
            more likely to use them in other contexts. We may talk about the propriety of
            government officials' dealings with private citizens, the propriety of the
            relationship between a lawyer and a judge, or the impropriety of speaking out
            of turn in a meeting that follows Robert's rules of order. Relations between
            men and women still present questions of propriety, but today it's often in the
            workplace rather than in social settings. Wherever rules, principles, and
            standard procedures have been clearly stated, propriety can become an issue.
            Something improper usually isn't actually illegal, but it makes people
            uncomfortable by giving the impression that something isn't quite right.</p>

        <p>appropriate (1) To take exclusive possession of, often
            without right. (2) To set apart for a particular purpose or use.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; It was one of those insulting words that sometimes get appropriated by a
            group that it's meant to insult, which then starts using it proudly and
            defiantly.
        </p>
        <p>From its roots, the verb appropriate would mean basically &ldquo;make one's
            own&rdquo;&mdash;that is, &ldquo;take,&rdquo; or sometimes &ldquo;grab.&rdquo; Each year the President and
            Congress create a budget and appropriate funds for each item in it, funds
            which mostly come in the form of taxes from the public. In the House of
            Representatives, the powerful Appropriations Committee often gets the last
            word on how much money goes to each program. &ldquo;Misappropriation of
            funds,&rdquo; on the other hand, is a nice way of saying &ldquo;theft.&rdquo; If someone
            appropriated pieces of your novel, you might take him or her to court; and if
            you appropriated trade secrets from your former employers, you might be the
            one sued.</p>

        <p>&bull; It was only when the country's new government threatened to expropriate
            the American oil refineries that Congress became alarmed.
        </p>
        <p>In ancient Rome, an emperor could condemn a wealthy senator, have him
            killed, and expropriate his property. In 1536 Henry VIII declared himself
            head of the new Church of England and expropriated the lands and wealth of
            the Roman Catholic monasteries. And nearly all of North America was
            expropriated from the American Indians, usually without any payment at all.
            Today, democratic governments only carry out legal expropriations, in which
            the owners are properly paid for their land&mdash;for example, when a highway or
            other public project needs to be built.</p>

        <p>TORT comes from a form of the Latin verb torquere, meaning &ldquo;to twist,
            wind, or wrench.&rdquo; In torture, parts of the body may be wrenched or twisted or
            stretched; so those &ldquo;Indian sunburns&rdquo; that schoolkids give by twisting in
            different directions on some unlucky guy's wrist stay pretty close to torture's
            original meaning.</p>
        <p />
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <p />
        <p>tort A wrongful act that does not involve breach of contract and for
            which the injured party can receive damages in a civil action.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The manufacturer was almost bankrupted by the massive tort actions
            brought by employees harmed by asbestos.
        </p>
        <p>Tort came into English straight from French many centuries ago, and it still
            looks a little odd. Its root meaning of &ldquo;twisted&rdquo; (as opposed to &ldquo;straight&rdquo;)
            obviously came to mean &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; (as opposed to &ldquo;right&rdquo;). Every first-year
            law student takes a course in the important subject of torts. Torts include all
            the so-called &ldquo;product-liability&rdquo; cases, against manufacturers of cars,
            household products, children's toys, and so on. They also cover dog bites,
            slander and libel, and a huge variety of other very personal cases of injury,
            both mental and physical&mdash;Torts class is never dull. If you're sued for a tort
            and lose, you usually have to pay &ldquo;damages&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a sum of money&mdash;to
            the person who you wronged.</p>

        <p>extort To obtain from a person by force, threats, or illegal power.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; She had tried to extort money from a film star, claiming that he was the
            father of her baby.
        </p>
        <p>To extort is literally to wrench something out of someone. Extortion is a
            mainstay of organized crime. Just as the school bully extorts lunch money
            from the smaller kids in exchange for not beating them up, thugs extort
            &ldquo;protection&rdquo; money from business owners with threats of violence. But that's
            only one kind of extortion; a mobster might extort favors from a politician
            with threats of revealing some dark secret, just as you might extort a favor
            from a brother or sister by promising not to tell on them.</p>
        <p />
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <p />
        <p>contort To twist in a violent manner.

        <p>&bull; The governor's explanation of his affair was so contorted that it only made
            matters worse for him.

        <p>Circus contortionists are known for twisting their bodies into pretzels; such
            contortions tend to be easier for females than for males, and much easier for
            the young than for the old. When trying to say something uncomfortable or
            dishonest, people often go through verbal contortions. But when someone
            else &ldquo;twists&rdquo; something you said or did, we usually say instead that they've
            distorted it.</p>

        <p>tortuous (1) Having many twists, bends, or turns; winding.
            (2) Crooked or tricky; involved, complex.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The road over the mountains was long and dangerously tortuous, and as you
            rounded the sharp corners you could never see whether a huge truck might be
            barreling down toward you.
        </p>
        <p>A labyrinth is a tortuous maze. The first labyrinth was built as a prison for the
            monstrous Minotaur, half bull and half man; only by holding one end of a
            thread was the heroic Theseus able to enter and slay the Minotaur and then
            exit. A tortuous problem, a tortuous history, and the tortuous path of a bill
            through Congress all have many unexpected twists and turns; a tortuous
            explanation or argument may be too crooked for its own good. Don't confuse
            tortuous with torturous, which means &ldquo;tortured&rdquo; or &ldquo;painfully unpleasant&rdquo;;
            tortuous has nothing to do with torture.</p>

        <p>bon vivant A sociable person with a love of excellent food

        <p>Bon vivant comes straight from French, where it means literally &ldquo;good liver,&rdquo;
            and is still pronounced in the French way, though we've actually been using it
            in English since the 17th century. A proper bon vivant has some money and
            lots of friends and plenty of style and knows a good wine and can tell a great
            story and loves to laugh. Because of all these requirements, true bons vivants
            are rather rare&mdash;but that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of people who hope

            energetic new principal can revivify a failing high school. After World War
            II, one European country after another was slowly revivified, their economies
            and cultural life gradually coming back to life. Notice that revivify looks like

        <p>Vivisection includes the Latin root sect, meaning &ldquo;cut.&rdquo; The Greek physician

            activity and whether veins and arteries carry air or blood; his findings formed
            the basis of medical practice for more than a thousand years. Vivisection

            well. A serviceable jacket is practical and maybe even rugged. But
            serviceable sometimes damns with faint praise. A serviceable performance is
            all right but not inspired. Serviceable curtains aren't the ideal color or pattern,
            but they serve their purpose. A serviceable pair of shoes is sturdy but won't
            win you any fashion points.</p>

        <p>&bull; The dog's manner was servile, and it lacked a healthy independence.
        </p>
        <p>During the Middle Ages, most of the farming was done by a servile class
            known as serfs, who enjoyed hardly any personal freedom. This began to
            change in the 14th century; but the Russian serfs weren't freed until the
            1860s, when the servile class in the U.S. was also freed. But servile today
            usually refers to a personal manner; a person who shows servility usually isn't
            a servant, but simply seems too eager to please and seems to lack self-
            respect.</p>

            like utter servitude.
        </p>
        <p>Servitude is slavery or anything resembling it. The entire black population of
            colonial America lived in permanent servitude. And millions of the whites
            who populated this country arrived in &ldquo;indentured servitude,&rdquo; obliged to pay
            off the cost of their journey with several years of labor. Servitude comes in
            many forms, of course: in the bad old days of the British navy, it was said
            that the difference between going to sea and going to jail was that you were
            less likely to drown in jail.</p>

        <p>&bull; Many have wondered why Congress always seems subservient to the
            financial industry, supporting it even when the voters are angrily calling for
            reforms.
        </p>
        <p>Since sub- means &ldquo;below,&rdquo; it emphasizes the lower position of the person in
            the subservient one. Soldiers of a given rank are always subservient to those
            of a higher rank; this subservience is symbolized by the requirement that they
            salute their superior at every opportunity. Women have often been forced into
            subservient relationships with men. A small nation may feel subservient to its
            more powerful neighbor, obliged to obey even when it doesn't want to. So
            subservience usually brings with it a good dose of resentment.</p>

        <p>CLUS comes from the Latin claudere, &ldquo;to close.&rdquo; Words based on the Latin

            which once meant &ldquo;to shut up or enclose&rdquo; and now means &ldquo;to contain,&rdquo; has

        <p>occlusion An obstruction or blockage; the act of obstructing

        <p>&bull; The doctors worry that a loosened piece of plaque from the artery wall
            could lead to an occlusion of a brain artery, resulting in a stroke.
        </p>
        <p>Occlusion, formed with the prefix ob-, here meaning &ldquo;in the way,&rdquo; occurs
            when something has been closed up or blocked off. Almost all heart attacks
            are the result of the occlusion of a coronary (heart) artery by a blood clot, and
            many strokes are caused by an occlusion in an artery serving the brain. When
            a person's upper and lower teeth form a malocclusion, they close incorrectly
            or badly. An occlusion, or occluded front, happens when a fast-moving cold
            front overtakes a slow-moving warm front and slides underneath it, lifting the
            warm air and blocking its movement.</p>

        <p>In words such as expel, export, and exclusive, the prefix ex- means &ldquo;out of,
            outside.&rdquo; Thus, to exclude means basically to close the door in order to keep
            someone or something out. When the word appears in an advertisement, it's
            often making an appeal to snobs. An &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; offer is supposedly made to
            only a few people; not so many years ago, &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; housing developments
            excluded those of a certain race or color. If a product is being sold exclusively
            by one store, you won't be able to find it anywhere else. When a newspaper
            or news show has an exclusive, it's a story that no one else has yet reported.
            Exclusive's antonym is inclusive; an inclusive policy, an inclusive church, or
            an inclusive approach is one that aims to include as many people as possible.</p>

        <p>Greta Garbo and Howard Hughes were two of the most famously reclusive

            most beautiful woman in the world; he had been an aircraft manufacturer and
            film producer, with one of the greatest fortunes in the world. It seems that
            Garbo's reclusiveness resulted from her desire to leave her public with only
            the youthful image of her face. Hughes was terrified of germs, though that
            was the least of his problems.</p>

        <p>With its prefix se-, &ldquo;apart,&rdquo; seclusion has the basic meaning of a place or
            condition that's &ldquo;closed away.&rdquo; A lone island may be secluded, and its
            seclusion might be what its owner prizes most about it. Presidents and their
            staffs may go into seclusion before making critical decisions. Monastery life
            is purposely secluded, and monks may have taken vows to live lives of
            seclusion. The deadly brown recluse spider prefers seclusion but is
            sometimes disturbed by very unlucky people.</p>

        <p>&bull; Last Saturday's upset victory over Michigan may prove to have been the
            acme of the entire season.
        </p>
        <p>In Greek, acme meant a mountain peak, but in English we hardly ever use it
            in the physical sense. Instead we speak of someone's new job as the acme of
            her career, or of a certain leap as the acme of classical dance technique. In old
            Road Runner cartoons, the Acme Company is the provider of every ingenious
            device imaginable. But the word can't always be taken quite literally as a
            brand or company name; it's possible, for instance, that something called the
            Acme Bar &amp; Grill may not be the absolutely highest and best example of a
            bar and grill. And don't confuse acme with acne, the skin disorder&mdash;even

        <p>catharsis A cleansing or purification of the body, emotions,
            or spirit.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Having broken down sobbing at the funeral, he said afterwards that it had
            felt like a catharsis.
        </p>
        <p>One of the earliest uses of catharsis is in Aristotle's Poetics, where the
            philosopher claims that watching a tragedy provides the spectators with a
            desirable catharsis because of the buildup and release of the emotions of pity
            and fear. Sigmund Freud borrowed the term as a name for the process of
            bringing a set of unconscious desires and ideas back into consciousness in
            order to eliminate their bad effects. Today some people claim it's cathartic to
            merely express your anger or grief, since it &ldquo;gets it out of your system.&rdquo;
            Laxatives are also called cathartic, since they provide a physical catharsis that
            some people believe to be healthful. But there's no general agreement about
            any of this, and the notion of catharsis remains a very personal one.</p>

        <p>The original colossi (notice the plural form) were the larger-than-life statues
            made by the Greeks and Romans. The most famous of these was the Colossus
            of Rhodes, a statue of the sun god Helios built on the Greek island of Rhodes
            around 280 B.C. that was over 100 feet tall and took more than 12 years to
            build. The Statue of Liberty is a modern colossus, enormous and stately, at
            the entrance to New York Harbor. And someone who has played a colossal
            role in history, such as Winston Churchill, may be called a colossus as well.</p>

            from the famous Funeral Oration by Pericles, where it was actually used in a
            positive way. Today it's generally used by people who think of themselves as
            superior&mdash;though it's also sometimes used in Pericles' democratic spirit. By
            the way, it has no relation to hoity-toity, meaning &ldquo;stuck-up,&rdquo; which starts

        <p>In Greek and Latin, a stigma was a mark or brand, especially one that marked
            a slave, so a stigma marked a person as inferior. When the plural form
            stigmata is used, it usually refers to the nail wounds on Christ's hands and
            feet, wounds which have sometimes reappeared on the hands or feet of later
            worshippers such as St. Francis. When stigma began to be used in English, it
            usually meant the kind of mark or stain you can't actually see. So today we
            hear about the stigma of homelessness, the stigma of overweight, and the
            stigma of mental illness. People may be so afraid of being stigmatized for
            losing a job that they'll put on their office clothes and drive out their
            driveways every weekday morning so that the neighbors won't know.</p>

        <p>TEXT comes from a Latin verb that means &ldquo;to weave.&rdquo; So a textile is a
            woven or knitted cloth. The material it's made from determines its texture, the
            smoothness or roughness of its surface. And individual words are &ldquo;woven&rdquo;
            into sentences and paragraphs to form a text.</p>

        <p>&bull; A textual analysis of 1,700 lipstick names, including Hot Mama and Raisin

        <p>Before the invention of the printing press, books were produced by hand.
            When the text of a book is copied this way, textual errors can creep in, and a
            text that's been copied again and again can contain many such errors. By
            comparing different copies of a work, textual critics try to figure out where
            the copyists went wrong and restore the text to its original form so that
            modern readers can again enjoy the correct versions of ancient texts. When a
            class performs textual analysis of a poem, however, they are looking closely
            at its individual words and phrases in an effort to determine the poem's
            meanings.</p>

        <p>context (1) The surrounding spoken or written material in

            an event occurs; environment or setting.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The governor claimed that his remarks were taken out of context and that
            anyone looking at the whole speech would get a different impression.
        </p>
        <p>Context reveals meaning. The context of an unfamiliar word can give us
            contextual clues to help us determine what the word means. Taking a remark
            out of context can change its meaning entirely. Likewise, people's actions
            sometimes have to be understood as having occurred in a particular context.
            The behavior of historical figures should be seen in the context of their time,
            when standards may have been very different from our own.</p>

        <p>hypertext A database format in which information related to
            that on a display screen can be accessed directly from the screen (as by a
            mouse click).
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Three days ago my mother was asking me why some of the words are
            underlined in blue, but by yesterday she was already an expert in hypertext.
        </p>
        <p>Since hyper- generally means &ldquo;above, beyond&rdquo; (see HYPER), hypertext is
            something that's gone beyond the limitations of ordinary text. Thus, unlike
            the text in a book, hypertext permits you, by clicking with a mouse, to
            immediately access text in one of millions of different electronic sources.
            Hypertext is now so familiar that most computer users may not even know
            the word, which was coined by Ted Nelson back in the early 1960s. It took a
            few more years for hypertext to actually be created, by Douglas Engelbart,
            and then quite a few more years before the introduction of the World Wide
            Web in 1991.</p>
        <p />

    <div class="page">
        <p />
        <p>subtext The underlying meaning of a spoken or written
            passage.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The tough and cynical tone of the story is contradicted by its romantic
            subtext.
        </p>
        <p>A literary text often has more than one meaning: the literal meaning of the
            words on the page, and their hidden meaning, what exists &ldquo;between the
            lines&rdquo;&mdash;the subtext. Arthur Miller's play The Crucible, for example, is about
            the Salem witchcraft trials of the 17th century, but its subtext is the
            comparison of those trials with the &ldquo;witch hunts&rdquo; of the 1950s, when many
            people were unfairly accused of being communists. Even a social
            conversation between a man and a woman may have a subtext, but you may
            have to listen very closely to figure out what it is. Don't confuse subtext with
            subplot, a less important plot that moves along in parallel with the main plot.</p>

        <p>PLAC comes from the Latin placere, &ldquo;to please or be agreeable to,&rdquo; or
            placare, &ldquo;to soothe or calm.&rdquo; Pleasant, pleasurable, and pleasing all derive
            from this root, even though their spelling makes it hard to see.</p>

        <p>placate To calm the anger or bitterness of someone.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The Romans had a number of ways of placating the gods, which
            occasionally included burying slaves alive.
        </p>
        <p>Politicians are constantly having to placate angry voters. Diplomats
            frequently need to placate a country's allies or possible enemies. Parents are
            always placating kids who think they've been unfairly denied something. And
            lovers and spouses are some of the champion placaters. It's no secret that
            people with the best social skills are often the best at placating other people&mdash;
            and that they themselves may be the ones who benefit the most by it.</p>

        <p>placebo A harmless substance given to a patient in place of
            genuine medication, either for experimental purposes or to soothe the patient.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The placebo worked miraculously: his skin rash cleared up, his sleep
            improved, and he even ceased to hear voices.
        </p>
        <p>Doctors doing research on new treatments for disease often give one group a
            placebo while a second group takes the new medication. Since those in the
            placebo group usually believe they're getting the real thing, their own hopeful
            attitude may bring about improvement in their condition. Thus, for the real
            drug to be considered effective, it must produce even better results than the
            placebo. Placebos have another use as well. A doctor who suspects that a
            patient's physical symptoms are psychologically produced may prescribe a
            placebo in the hope that mentally produced symptoms can also be mentally
            cured.</p>

            the huge loss she had suffered.
        </p>
        <p>A placid lake has a smooth surface untouched by wind. A placid scene is one
            in which everything seems calm; it may even include a meadow with a few
            placid cows grazing on it. Someone with a placid personality has an inner
            peacefulness that isn't easily disturbed. As a personality trait, placidity is
            surely a lot better than some of the alternatives; however, the word
            sometimes describes people who are also a bit passive, like those contented
            cows.</p>

        <p>&bull; Attempts to negotiate a peace settlement between such implacable enemies
            seem doomed to failure.
        </p>
        <p>Implacable, with its negative prefix im-, describes something or someone that
            can't be calmed or soothed or altered. A person who carries a grudge feels an
            implacable resentment&mdash;a resentment that can't be soothed. An implacable
            foe is one you can't negotiate with, perhaps one who's fueled by implacable
            hatred. And implacable sometimes describes things that only seem to be
            alive: an implacable storm is one that seems as if it will never let up, and an
            implacable fate is one that you can't outrun or hide from.</p>

            automatic operates by itself, and an automobile moves by itself, without the
            help of a horse. An autograph is in the handwriting of the person him- or

        <p>automaton (1) An automatic machine, especially a robot. (2)

        <p>&bull; The work he used to do as a welder in the assembly plant has been taken
            over by a sophisticated automaton designed overseas.
        </p>
        <p>The idea of the automaton has fascinated people for many centuries. A
            traveler to the emperor's court in Byzantium in A.D. 949 reported that
            mechanical birds sat in a golden tree singing the songs of their species; that
            mechanical lions flanked the throne, roaring and switching their great tails;
            and that, as he stood watching, the emperor's throne suddenly shot upward
            toward the high ceiling, and when it slowly descended the emperor was
            wearing new robes. Early automata (notice the common plural form) often
            relied on water, steam, or falling weights to power them. Today automata,
            often called robots, are used in manufacturing plants to build not only
            vehicles but also much smaller electronic equipment.</p>

        <p>autoimmune Of, relating to, or caused by antibodies that

        <p>&bull; His doctors suspected that the strange combination of symptoms might be
            those of an autoimmune disease.
        </p>
        <p>Any healthy body produces a variety of antibodies, proteins in the blood
            whose job is to protect the body from unwanted bacteria, viruses, and cancer
            cells. The cells and organs that deal with such infections make up the
            immune system. In some people and animals, for various reasons, the
            antibodies become overactive and turn on the body's healthy tissues as well;
            the result is an autoimmune disease&mdash;an immune response directed against
            one's own self. More than eighty autoimmune diseases have been identified,
            the best-known being type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and
            rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

            Palestinians in certain towns in Israel, or of independent-minded regions of
            Russia, have become major issues. The autonomy of individual states in the
            United States has posed serious constitutional questions for two centuries.

        <p>autism \ A condition that begins in childhood and causes

        <p>Autism, in its strict sense, becomes evident before the age of 3. The autistic
            child generally refuses to talk, becomes obsessive about toys, resists any
            change vehemently, and sometimes flies into unexplained rages. Autism is
            believed to be biological in origin, and seems to be related to several milder
            conditions such as Asperger's syndrome. As many as 1 in 100 children,

            ability to play a difficult piece on the piano after a single hearing or repair a
            complex machine without any training. Many autistic children seem to grow
            out of it as they become adults, and some autistic adults manage to live
            independently. Autistic is sometimes used loosely to describe a much more
            common kind of psychological withdrawal in adults.</p>

        <p>A gratifying experience is quietly pleasing or satisfying. But gratifying an

            &ldquo;instant gratification&rdquo; of every desire will result in a life based on junk food

        <p>Gratuity is a fancier and more formal word than tip. It occurs most often in
            written notices along the lines of &ldquo;Gratuities accepted.&rdquo; Its formality makes it
            best suited for describing tips of the dignified, expensive variety. For the taxi

            unwelcome. To insult or criticize someone gratuitously is to make a hurtful

        <p>The clamor on Broadway at midday can be astonishing to a tourist from a
            midwestern town; if they happen to be digging up the street with
            jackhammers, the clamor can be even worse. The clamor on the floor of a
            stock exchange goes on without stopping for seven hours every day. A
            clamor of protest may sometimes be quieter, but is often just as hard to
            ignore. A politican who receives a thousand e-mails a day clamoring for his

        <p>&bull; To the principal's suggestion that Friday be a holiday to honor the victors in

        </p>
        <p>Approval can come from a single person, but acclamation requires a larger
            audience. An acclaimed movie is widely praised, and critical acclaim can
            lead to box-office success. When a popular proposal comes up in a
            legislature, the speaker may ask that it be passed &ldquo;by acclamation,&rdquo; which
            means that everyone just gets to yell and cheer in approval and no one

        <p>The pro- in proclaim means &ldquo;forward, out,&rdquo; so a proclamation is an
            &ldquo;outward&rdquo; statement intended for the public. We often think of proclamations
            as something issued by monarchs or dictators, but Lincoln was able to issue
            his Emancipation Proclamation because as president he had the power to free
            the slaves in certain areas. At a slightly lower level, a governor may proclaim

        <p>Since aristos means &ldquo;best&rdquo; in Greek, ancient Greeks such as Plato and

            people&mdash;that is, those who deserved to rule because of their intelligence and
            moral excellence. But this kind of &ldquo;best&rdquo; soon became something you could
            inherit from your parents. The United States has no formal aristocracy&mdash;no
            noble titles such as baron or marquis that stay in the family&mdash;but certain
            American families have achieved an almost aristocratic status because of the

        <p>Autos in Greek means &ldquo;same&rdquo; or &ldquo;self,&rdquo; so in an autocratic government all the

            they usually have to stick so close to the rules, bureaucrats do almost all the
            day-to-day work that keeps a government running. The idea of a bureaucracy
            is to split up the complicated task of governing a large country into smaller
            jobs that can be handled by specialists. Bureaucratic government is nothing
            new; the Roman empire had an enormous and complex bureaucracy, with the
            bureaucrats at lower levels reporting to bureaucrats above them, and so on up

        <p>Ploutos was Greek for &ldquo;wealth,&rdquo; and Plouton, or Pluto, was one of the names
            used for the Greek god of the underworld, where all the earth's mineral
            wealth was stored. So a plutocracy governs or wields power through its
            money. The economic growth in the U.S. in the late 19th century produced a
            group of enormously wealthy plutocrats. Huge companies like John D.
            Rockefeller's Standard Oil gained serious political power, and Rockefeller
            was able to influence lawmakers in states where his businesses operated. For
            this reason, it was said in 1905 that Ohio and New Jersey were plutocracies,

        </p>
        <p>In Latin, acus means &ldquo;needle,&rdquo; and the English word acupuncture was coined
            way back in the 17th century to describe a technique the Chinese had already
            been using for 2,000 years. An acupuncturist may insert many extremely fine
            needles at a time; the treatment is usually uncomfortable but not truly painful.
            In China today, even major surgery is often carried out using only
            acupuncture to kill the pain; it's also used for many other conditions,
            including insomnia, depression, smoking, and overweight. Acupuncture is
            based on ancient theories of bodily energy that few Western doctors have
            ever accepted; but even though attempts to explain its effects by Western
            science have been unsuccessful, it's now widely recognized by doctors as
            effective for pain reduction.</p>

        <p>POT comes from the Latin adjective potens, meaning &ldquo;able.&rdquo; Our English
            word potent means &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; or &ldquo;effective,&rdquo; whether for good or bad. A
            potent new antibiotic might be able to deal with infections that have
            developed resistance to older drugs; an industrial gas might be identified as a
            potent contributor to climate change; and a potent drink might leave you

        <p>&bull; If the plan works we'll be millionaires, but the potential for disaster is high.
        </p>
        <p>Potential can be either good or bad. Studying hard increases the potential for
            success, but wet roads increase the potential for accidents. But when a person
            or thing &ldquo;has potential,&rdquo; we always expect something good from it in the
            future. As an adjective (as in &ldquo;potential losses,&rdquo; &ldquo;potential benefits,&rdquo; etc.),
            potential usually means simply &ldquo;possible.&rdquo; In science, however, the adjective
            has a special meaning: Potential energy is the kind of stored energy that a
            boulder sitting at the top of a cliff has (the opposite of kinetic energy, which
            is what it has as it rolls down that cliff).</p>

        <p>Back in the 12th century, when the Roman Catholic Church in some ways
            resembled the powerful Roman empire that had come before it, the Church
            revived the Roman concept of an official with plena potens&mdash;&ldquo;full powers&rdquo;&mdash;
            to negotiate agreements (see PLE/PLEN). Whereas an ambassador could only
            make offers that a faraway ruler had specified, often weeks or months earlier,
            a plenipotentiary could negotiate an entire agreement without checking back
            constantly with his ruler. Today, with instant electronic communications, this
            distinction has generally lost its importance, but there are still ambassadors
            who wouldn't be allowed at a negotiating table.</p>

        <p>Like such titles as grand vizier, caliph, and khan, potentate summons up
            thoughts of absolute rulers of an earlier age in such lands as Turkey, Persia,
            and India. It often suggests a person who uses power or authority in a cruel
            and unjust way&mdash;that is, a tyrant. Today, though it's still used as a title by the
            organization called the Shriners, it's more often used humorously (&ldquo;Supreme

        <p>ambrosia (1) The food of the Greek and Roman gods. (2)

            them.
        </p>
        <p>Ambrosia literally means &ldquo;immortality&rdquo; in Greek, and in Greek and Roman
            mythology only the immortals&mdash;the gods and goddesses&mdash;could eat ambrosia
            or drink nectar. Both may have been divine forms of honey. The gods also
            used nectar and ambrosia like oils for ceremonial anointing, and a mixture of
            water, oil, and fruits called ambrosia came to be used in human ceremonies as
            well. Since we can't know what the mythical ambrosia tasted or smelled like,
            we mere mortals are free to give the name to our favorite ambrosial dessert&mdash;

            any kind are harder to resolve when both sides are dogmatic in their beliefs.
            Dogma and dogmatic are generally used disapprovingly; it's always other
            people who believe unquestioningly in dogma and who take a dogmatic
            approach to important issues.</p>

        <p>eureka An exclamation used to express triumph and delight on a

        <p>&bull; The mountain town of Eureka, California, was named for the cries of
            delight by prospectors when they discovered gold in them thar hills.
        </p>
        <p>Eureka means &ldquo;I have found&rdquo; in Greek. The story goes that the Greek
            inventor Archimedes, given the task of determining the purity of gold in a
            crown, shouted &ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo; one day after stepping into a bath and making
            water slop over the side, when he suddenly realized that the weight of water
            displaced indicated the bulk of his body, but that a larger body made of
            lighter matter might weigh the same but would displace more water. Thus, a
            crown in which lighter metal had secretly been mixed with the gold would
            reveal itself in the same way. The story may not be true, but we still shout
            &ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo; when we make a sudden, welcome discovery.</p>

            country's dangerous military power, which had been made possible by its oil.
        </p>
        <p>We generally use per se to distinguish between something in its narrow sense
            and some larger thing that it represents. Thus, you may have no objection to
            educational testing per se, but rather to the way testing is done. An opposition
            party may attack a president's policy not because they dislike the policy per
            se but because they want to weaken the president. And when New York's
            police chief decided to crack down on small crimes, it wasn't the small crimes
            per se that were his target, but instead the larger crimes which he believed
            would be reduced because of this new approach.</p>

        <p>opus A creative work, especially a musical composition or set of
            compositions numbered in order of publication.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is also known as Opus (Op.) 125.
        </p>
        <p>A literary opus is often a single novel, though the word may sometimes refer
            to all of a writer's works. But opus normally is used for musical works.
            Mendelssohn's Opus 90 is his Italian Symphony, for example, and Brahms's
            Op. 77 is his Violin Concerto. Since many composers' works were never
            given opus numbers in an orderly way, they now often have catalog numbers
            assigned by later scholars. So Haydn's Symphony No. 104 is Hob.104 (Hob.
            is short for Anthony van Hoboken, the cataloger), and Mozart's Marriage of
            Figaro is K.492 (K. stands for Ludwig K&ouml;chel).</p>

        <p>An impetus can be something positive and pleasant, or something negative
            and unpleasant, but in either case it stimulates action. The need to earn a
            living provides many people with the impetus to drag themselves out of bed
            five mornings a week. On the other two days, the impetus might be the smell
            of bacon cooking, or the idea of an early-morning round of golf. Impetus can

        <p>MAND comes from mandare, Latin for &ldquo;entrust&rdquo; or &ldquo;order.&rdquo; A command is
            an order; a commandment is also an order, but usually one that comes from
            God. And a commando unit carries out orders for special military actions.</p>

        <p>mandate (1) A formal command. (2) Permission to act, given
            by the people to their representatives.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The new president claimed his landslide victory was a mandate from the
            voters to end the war.
        </p>
        <p>A mandate from a leader is a command you can't refuse. But that kind of
            personal command is rarely the meaning of mandate today; much more
            common are connected with institutions. Thus, the Clean Air Act was a
            mandate from Congress to clean up air pollution&mdash;and since mandate is also
            a verb, we could say instead that the Clear Air Act mandated new restrictions
            on air pollution. Elections are often interpreted as mandates from the public
            for certain kinds of action. But since a politician is not just a symbol of
            certain policies but also an individual who might happen to have an awfully
            nice smile, it can be risky to interpret most elections as mandating anything at
            all.</p>

        <p>&bull; If attendance at the meeting hadn't been mandatory, she would have just
            gone home.
        </p>
        <p>Something mandatory is the result of a mandate or order, which usually
            comes in the form of a law, rule, or regulation. Today there seem to be a lot
            of these mandates, so mandatory seat belts, mandatory inspections for
            industries, and mandatory prison sentences for violent crimes are regularly in
            the news. But mandatory retirement at age 65, which used to be common, is
            now illegal in most cases.</p>

        <p>commandeer To take possession of something by force,

        <p>&bull; No sooner had they started their meeting than the boss showed up and
            commandeered the conference room.
        </p>
        <p>Military forces have always had the power to commandeer houses. The
            Declaration of Independence complains about the way the British soldiers
            have done it, and the third Amendment to the Constitution states that the
            commandeering of people's houses shall be done only in a way prescribed by
            law. Almost anything&mdash;food, supplies, livestock, etc.&mdash;can be militarily
            commandeered when the need arises. But you don't have to be in the military
            for someone to &ldquo;pull rank&rdquo; on you: Your father may commandeer the car just
            when you were about to take it out for the evening, your teacher may
            commandeer your cell phone as you're texting in the middle of class, or your
            older sister may commandeer the TV remote to watch some lousy dancing
            competition.</p>

        <p>remand (1) To order a case sent back to another court or agency

        <p>&bull; The state supreme court had remanded the case to the superior court,
            instructing it to consider the new evidence.
        </p>
        <p>Remand means &ldquo;order back&rdquo; or &ldquo;send back.&rdquo; After losing a case in a lower
            court, lawyers will frequently appeal it to a higher court. If the higher court
            looks at the case and sees that the lower court made certain kinds of errors, it
            will simply remand it, while telling the lower court how it fell short the first
            time: by not instructing the jury thoroughly, for example, or by not taking
            into account a recent related court decision.</p>

        <p>&bull; As news of the singer's death spread, retailers were inundated with orders
            for all his old recordings.
        </p>
        <p>In the summer of 1993, record rains in the Midwest caused the Mississippi
            River to overflow its banks, break through levees, and inundate the entire
            countryside; such an inundation hadn't been seen for at least a hundred years.
            By contrast, the Nile River inundated its entire valley every year, bringing the
            rich black silt that made the valley one of the most fertile places on earth.
            (The inundations ceased with the completion of the Aswan High Dam in
            1970.) Whenever a critical issue is being debated, the White House and
            Congressional offices are inundated with phone calls and e-mails, just as a
            town may be inundated with complaints when it starts charging a fee for
            garbage pickup.</p>

        <p>redound (1) To have an effect for good or bad. (2) To rebound

        </p>
        <p>&bull; Each new military victory redounded to the glory of the king, whose
            brilliance as a leader was now praised and feared throughout Europe.
        </p>
        <p>Redound has had a confusing history. Its original meaning was simply
            &ldquo;overflow.&rdquo; But since the prefix re- often means &ldquo;back,&rdquo; the later meaning
            &ldquo;result&rdquo; may have arisen because flowing back&mdash;on a beach, for example&mdash;is
            a result of the original flowing. Redound has long been confused with other
            words such as resound and rebound, so today &ldquo;rebound&rdquo; is another of its
            standard meanings. As examples of its usual meaning, we could say that the
            prohibition of alcohol in 1919 redounded unintentionally to the benefit of
            gangsters such as Al Capone&mdash;and that Capone's jailing on tax-evasion
            charges redounded to the credit of the famous &ldquo;Untouchables.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>redundancy (1) The state of being extra or unnecessary.

        </p>
        <p>&bull; A certain amount of redundancy can help make a speaker's points clear, but
            too much can be annoying.
        </p>
        <p>Redundancy, closely related to redound, has stayed close to the original
            meaning of &ldquo;overflow&rdquo; or &ldquo;more than necessary.&rdquo; Avoiding redundancy is
            one of the prime rules of good writing. &ldquo;&ldquo;In the modern world of today&rdquo;
            contains a redundancy; so does &ldquo;He died of fatal wounds&rdquo; and &ldquo;For the
            mutual benefit of both parties.&rdquo; But redundancy doesn't just occur in
            language. &ldquo;Data redundancy&rdquo; means keeping the same computer data in more
            than one place as a safety measure, and a backup system in an airplane may
            provide redundancy, again for the sake of safety.</p>

        <p>SANCT meaning &ldquo;holy,&rdquo; comes from the Latin word sanctus. Thus, sanctity
            means &ldquo;holiness.&rdquo; In ancient Greece, a spot could be sanctified, or &ldquo;made
            holy,&rdquo; by a group of priests who carried out a solemn ritual; these might be
            spots where fumes arose from a crack in the earth or where a spring of clear
            water flowed out of the ground, and a temple might be built there for worship
            of a god.</p>

        <p>sanction To give approval to.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The bill's opponents claimed that removing criminal penalties for drug
            possession would amount to sanctioning drug use.
        </p>
        <p>Sanction originally meant &ldquo;make holy&rdquo; or &ldquo;give official church approval to.&rdquo;
            The word still has a solemn sound to it, so sanctioning is something generally
            done by an institution or government, though not necessarily by a church. So
            a college may sanction&mdash;or &ldquo;give its blessing to&rdquo;&mdash;the use of office space by
            a gay organization, or a hot-rod association may sanction two new tracks for
            official races. But sanction is also a noun, which may have two near-opposite
            meanings, &ldquo;approval&rdquo; and &ldquo;penalty.&rdquo; Thus, a company may be accused of
            giving its sanction to illegal activities. But when two or more countries
            impose sanctions on another country, it often involves cutting off trade. No
            wonder sanction is such a tricky word for so many of us.</p>

        <p>sanctimonious Pretending to be more religiously

        <p>&bull; The candidates' speeches were sanctimonious from beginning to end, filled
            with stories about how their deep faith was the basis for everything they did.
        </p>
        <p>Making a show of your religious morality has always struck some people the
            wrong way, including Jesus. In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus preaches
            that, when we give away money for charity, we shouldn't let our left hand
            know what our right hand is doing&mdash;that is, the giving should be done for its
            own sake and other people shouldn't be told about it. Those who make a
            display of how good and pious they are called hypocrites. But sanctimony, or
            sanctimoniousness, has often been a good strategy for American politicians,
            many of whom have found it a great way to win votes.</p>

        <p>sacrosanct (1) Most sacred or holy. (2) Treated as if holy

        <p>Sacrosanct means literally &ldquo;made holy by a sacred rite,&rdquo; and in its original
            use the word was reserved for things of the utmost holiness. But sacrosanct is
            now used to describe a questionable sacredness which nevertheless makes
            something immune from attack or violation; that is, the person using the word
            usually doesn't regard the thing as sacred at all. So to call a government
            program sacrosanct is to imply that others regard it as untouchable. And a
            piece of writing is more likely to be thought of as sacrosanct by its author
            than by the editor who has to fix it up.</p>

        <p>sanctuary (1) A holy place, such as a church or temple,

            bustle.
        </p>
        <p>Historically, churches have been places where fugitives could seek at least
            temporary protection from the law. In Anglo-Saxon England, churches and
            churchyards generally provided 40 days of immunity, and neither the sheriffs
            nor the army would enter to seize the outlaw. But gradually the right of
            sanctuary was eroded. In 1486 sanctuary for the crime of treason was
            disallowed, and sanctuary for most other crimes was severely restricted by
            Henry VIII and later abolished. In the 1980s many U.S. churches provided
            sanctuary to political refugees from Central America, and the U.S.
            government mostly chose not to interfere. Today, wildlife sanctuaries provide
            protection for the species within its boundaries, and farm-animal sanctuaries
            now rescue livestock from abuse and starvation.</p>

        <p>Since solus means &ldquo;alone&rdquo; in Latin, soliloquies take place when a character is

            have no trouble in expressing to the reader a character's personal thoughts,
            but such expression is less natural to stage drama. The soliloquies of

        <p>colloquial Conversational in style.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The author, though obviously a professional writer, uses a colloquial style
            in this new book.
        </p>
        <p>Since colloquy means basically &ldquo;conversation,&rdquo; colloquial language is the
            language almost all of us speak. It uses contractions (&ldquo;can't,&rdquo; &ldquo;it's,&rdquo;
            &ldquo;they've&rdquo;), possibly some slang, lots of short words and not many long ones.
            But our language usually changes when we write, becoming more formal and
            sometimes even &ldquo;literary.&rdquo; Except in e-mails and text messages, many people
            never write a contraction or use the word &ldquo;I&rdquo;, and avoid informal words
            completely. But colloquial language isn't necessarily bad in writing, and it's
            sometimes more appropriate than the alternative.</p>

        <p>A loquacious speaker can leave a big audience stifling its yawns after the first
            45 minutes, and the loquaciousness of a dinner guest can keep everyone else
            from getting a word in edgewise. Loquacious letters used to go on for pages,
            and a loquacious author might produce a 1,200-page novel. Lincoln's brief
            269-word Gettysburg Address was delivered after a two-hour, 13,000-word
            speech by America's most famous orator, a windbag of loquacity.</p>

        <p>VIR is Latin for &ldquo;man.&rdquo; A virtue is a good quality&mdash;originally, the kind of
            quality an ideal man possessed. And virtuous behavior is morally excellent.

            established his virility beyond any doubt.
        </p>
        <p>Luckily, there's no doubt about what virility is, since it's depicted on the
            covers of dozens of new romance novels every month! A masterful and
            dominating manner, a splendid bared chest, a full head of lustrous hair, and
            an array of stunning costumes seem to be what's required. (Virile traits often
            missing in these men are hair on the chest and any hint of future baldness.)
            High-school football provides a showplace for demonstrations of adolescent
            virility, and for years afterward virile high-school players can keep using
            football language in their business life: &ldquo;get to the red zone,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hail Mary

        <p>&bull; A triumvirate slowly emerged as the inner circle of the White House, and
            the vice president wasn't among them.
        </p>
        <p>The first triumvirate of the Roman Republic, which consisted of Julius
            Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, was simply an alliance or partnership, not a
            formal institution of the government. The alliance didn't last long, however,
            and Caesar eventually emerged with total power. This led to his
            assassination, after which a second triumvirate took over, with Octavian,
            Mark Antony, and Lepidus dividing the Roman world among themselves.
            But these triumvirs also soon turned on one another, with Octavian alone

        <p>virago A loud, bad-tempered, overbearing woman.

        <p>&bull; The staff called her a virago and other things behind her back, but everyone
            was respectful of her abilities.
        </p>
        <p>The original Latin meaning of virago was &ldquo;female warrior.&rdquo; But in later
            centuries the meaning shifted toward the negative. The most famous virago in
            English literature is the ferocious Kate in Shakespeare's The Taming of the
            Shrew. Some historical viragoes have also become famous. Agrippina
            poisoned her husband, the Emperor Claudius, so that her son Nero could take
            his place (but it was Nero himself who eventually had her assassinated). And
            Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, a powerful virago of the 12th century, was
            imprisoned by her husband, King Henry II of England, after she encouraged
            their sons to rebel against him. Today some people are beginning to use
            virago admiringly again.</p>

            and a virtuoso performance is one that astonishes the audience by its feats. In
            ancient Greece the cities would hold male competitions in acrobatics,
            conjuring, public reciting, blowing the trumpet, and acting out scenes from
            Homer's epics, the winners of which would have been praised as virtuous, or

        <p>Modern democracies have institutions and offices that are roughly equivalent

            equivalent in the British Parliament. The heavily armored knight on his great
            armored horse has been called the Middle Ages' equivalent of the army tank.
            In none of these examples are the two things identical to each other; they're

            killed more American Indians than the armed settlers did. But prevalent
            doesn't just describe diseases. One ideal of male or female beauty may be
            prevalent in a particular society and quite a different ideal in another. In the
            1950s and '60s, there was a prevalent notion that if you went swimming less
            than an hour after eating you might drown because of stomach cramps&mdash;

        <p>effusive (1) Given to excessive display of feeling. (2) Freely

        </p>
        <p>&bull; At the victory party she lavished effusive praise on all her supporters for
            almost half an hour.
        </p>
        <p>Since to effuse is to &ldquo;pour out,&rdquo; an effusive person makes a habit of pouring
            out emotions. Greeting someone effusively may include great hugs and wet
            kisses. Academy Award winners tend to become embarrassingly effusive
            once they've got the microphone. But at least effusiveness is generally an
            expression of positive rather than negative emotions.</p>

        <p>A profusion is literally a &ldquo;pouring forth,&rdquo; so a profusion of gifts is a wealth or

        <p>The odors of baking may suffuse a room, and so may the light of a sunset. A

            hope, or love. A novel may be suffused with Irish humor, and a room may be
            suffused with firelight. Scientists may even describe an insect's gray wings as

        <p>apologia A defense, especially of one's own ideas, opinions,
            or actions.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; His resignation speech was an eloquent apologia for his controversial
            actions as chairman.
        </p>
        <p>An apologia and an apology usually aren't the same thing. An apology
            includes an admission of wrongdoing, but an apologia rarely apologizes in
            this sense, instead seeking to justify what was done. So, for example, in 1992
            some of the books published for the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage
            were apologias explaining why European powers such as Spain acted as they
            did in the New World: because, for example, the Aztecs were a cruel people,
            practicing human sacrifice in grotesque ways (victims were skinned, and their
            skins were worn by the high priests), and Christianity hoped to reform them.
            Of course, the Spanish Inquisition was torturing and executing nonbelievers
            at the same time&mdash;but that would be the subject of other apologias.</p>

        <p>atrium (1) An open rectangular patio around which a house is
            built. (2) A court with a skylight in a many-storied building.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Best of all, their new home had a large atrium, where they could eat
            breakfast in the fresh air in spring and summer.
        </p>
        <p>In malls and grand office buildings today, the enclosed atrium, often with
            full-size trees growing in it and high indoor balconies with hanging vines, has
            become a common architectural feature. But the original atria (notice the
            unusual plural) were open to the sky and occupied the center of a house or
            villa in ancient Rome. The open Roman courtyard allowed air to circulate and
            light to enter, and even its plantings helped cool the house. Situating the
            cooking fireplace in the atrium was another way of keeping the house itself
            cool. Still today, houses around the Mediterranean Sea and in tropical Latin
            America often have internal courtyards.</p>

        <p>oligarchy A government in which power is in the hands of a
            small group.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The population was shackled by an iron-willed oligarchy that dictated every
            aspect of their lives and ruthlessly crushed any hint of rebellion.
        </p>
        <p>Oligarchy combines roots from the Greek words oligos, meaning &ldquo;few,&rdquo; and
            archos, meaning &ldquo;leader or ruler.&rdquo; In ancient Greece, an aristocracy was
            government by the &ldquo;best&rdquo; (in Greek, aristos) citizens. An oligarchy was a
            corrupted aristocracy, one in which a few evil men unjustly seized power and
            used it to further their own ends. Since at least 1542, oligarchy has been used
            in English to describe oppressive governments of the kind that serve the
            interests of a few very wealthy families.</p>

        <p>encomium Glowing, enthusiastic praise, or an expression
            of such praise.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The surprise guest at the farewell party was the school's most famous
            graduate, who delivered a heartfelt encomium to the woman he called his
            favorite teacher of all.
        </p>
        <p>Encomium comes straight from Latin. Mark Antony's encomium to the dead
            Caesar in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar (&ldquo;Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend
            me your ears&rdquo;) is one of the most famous encomiums of all time, while Ben
            Jonson's encomium to the dead Shakespeare (&ldquo;He was not of an age, but for
            all time&rdquo;) has also been widely read and discussed. The British poet laureate
            is expected to compose poetic encomiums to mark special events or to praise
            a person honored by the state. And any awards banquet is thick with
            encomiums, with each speaker trying to outdo the last in praise of those being
            honored.</p>

        <p>neurosis A mental and emotional disorder that is less severe

        </p>
        <p>&bull; He has a neurosis about dirt, and is constantly washing his hands.
        </p>
        <p>A neurosis is a somewhat mild mental disorder; unexplained anxiety attacks,
            unreasonable fears, depression, and physical symptoms that are mentally
            caused are all examples of neurotic conditions. A superstitious person who
            compulsively knocks on wood or avoids anything with the number 13 might
            be suffering from a harmless neurosis. But a severe neurosis such as
            agoraphobia (see agoraphobia) can be very harmful, making a person a
            prisoner of his or her home. Neurosis is based on the Greek word for &ldquo;nerve,&rdquo;
            since until quite recently neurotic behavior was often blamed on the nerves.
            Neurosis is usually contrasted with psychosis, which includes a considerably
            more serious group of conditions.</p>

        <p>opprobrium (1) Something that brings disgrace. (2) A

        <p>&bull; The writers of the New Testament hold the Pharisees up to opprobrium for
            their hypocrisy and hollow spirituality.
        </p>
        <p>Witches have long been the objects of opprobrium; in Europe in the 16th and
            17th centuries, women thought to be witches were burned by the thousands.
            The opprobrious crime of treason could likewise result in the most hideous
            torture and execution. In The Scarlet Letter, the sin of adultery in Puritan
            times brought opprobrium on Hester Prynne. Today the country of Israel is
            the object of opprobrium in many countries, while the Palestinians suffer
            similar opprobrium in others. And mere smokers, or even overweight people,
            may sometimes feel themselves to be the objects of mild opprobrium.</p>

        <p>referendum (1) The referring of legislative measures to
            the voters for approval or rejection. (2) A vote on such a measure.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The referendum on the tax needed for constructing the new hospital passed
            by seven votes.
        </p>
        <p>Referendum is a Latin word, but its modern meaning only dates from the 19th
            century, when a new constitution adopted by Switzerland stated that the
            voters could vote directly on certain issues. Thus, a referendum is a measure
            that's referred (that is, sent on) to the people. Since the U.S. Constitution
            doesn't provide for referenda (notice the common plural form) at the national
            level, referenda tend to be on local and state issues. In most locales, a few
            questions usually appear on the ballot at election time, often involving such
            issues as new zoning ordinances, new taxes for schools, and new limits on
            spending.</p>

        <p>ultimatum A final proposal, condition, or demand,

        <p>&bull; The ultimatum to Iraq in 1991 demanding that it withdraw from Kuwait was
            ignored, and a U.S.-led invasion was the response.
        </p>
        <p>An ultimatum is usually issued by a stronger power to a weaker one, since it
            wouldn't carry much weight if the one giving the ultimatum couldn't back up
            its threat. Near the end of World War II, the Allied powers issued an
            ultimatum to Japan: surrender completely or face the consequences. Japan
            rejected the ultimatum, and within days the U.S. had dropped atomic bombs
            on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing some 200,000 people.</p>

        <p>VERB comes from the Latin verbum, meaning &ldquo;word.&rdquo; A verb&mdash;or action
            word&mdash;appears in some form in every complete sentence. To express
            something verbally&mdash;or to verbalize something&mdash;is to say it or write it.</p>

        <p>verbose Using more words than are needed; wordy.

        <p>&bull; The writing style in government publications has often been both dry and
            verbose&mdash;a deadly combination.
        </p>
        <p>Americans brought up on fast-paced TV shows and action films have lost any
            patience they once had for verbosity. So most American writing is brisk, and
            American speakers usually don't waste many words. But many of us love our
            own voices and opinions and don't realize we're being verbose until our
            listeners start stifling their yawns. And students still try to fill up the pages of
            their term papers with unneeded verbosity.</p>

        <p>proverb A brief, often-repeated statement that expresses a
            general truth or common observation.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; &ldquo;Waste not, want not&rdquo; used to be a favorite proverb in many households.
        </p>
        <p>Proverbs probably appeared with the dawn of language. Sayings such as &ldquo;A
            stitch in time saves nine,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pride goeth before a fall,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Least said,
            soonest mended,&rdquo; or &ldquo;To everything there is a season&rdquo; are easily memorized
            nuggets of wisdom. But the convenient thing about proverbs is that there's
            often one for every point of view. For every &ldquo;Look before you leap&rdquo; there's a
            &ldquo;He who hesitates is lost.&rdquo; &ldquo;A fool and his money are soon parted&rdquo; can be
            countered with &ldquo;To make money you have to spend money.&rdquo; A cynic once
            observed, &ldquo;Proverbs are invaluable treasures to dunces with good memories.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>verbatim In the exact words; word for word.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; It turned out that the writer had lifted long passages verbatim from an
            earlier, forgotten biography of the statesman.
        </p>
        <p>Verbatim comes directly from Latin into English with the same spelling and
            meaning. Memorizing famous speeches, poems, or literary passages is a good
            way to both train the memory and absorb the classic texts of our literature
            and culture. At one time the ability to recite verbatim the Gettysburg Address,
            the beginning of the Declaration of Independence, and great speeches from
            Shakespeare was the mark of a well-educated person. But when that language
            was quoted by a writer, he or she was always careful to put quotation marks
            around it and tell readers who the true author was.</p>

        <p>verbiage An excess of words, often with little content;
            wordiness.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The agency's report was full of unnecessary verbiage, which someone
            should have edited out before the report was published.
        </p>
        <p>Government reports are notorious for their unfortunate tendency toward
            empty verbiage, through part of the reason is simply that officials are anxious
            to be following all the rules. Legal documents are also generally full of
            verbiage, partly because lawyers want to be sure that every last possibility
            has been covered and no loopholes have been left. But writing that contains
            unneeded verbiage is often trying to disguise its lack of real substance or
            clarity of thought. And every writer, including government workers and
            lawyers, should be constantly on the lookout for opportunities to hit the
            Delete key.</p>

        <p>SIMIL/SIMUL come from the Latin adjective similis, meaning &ldquo;like,
            resembling, similar,&rdquo; and the verb simulare, &ldquo;to make like.&rdquo; Two similar
            things resemble each other. Two simultaneous activities proceed at the same
            time. And a facsimile, such as you might receive from your fax machine,
            looks exactly the same as the original.</p>

        <p>simile A figure of speech, introduced by as or like, that makes a

        <p>&bull; He particularly liked the simile he'd thought of for the last line of the song's
            chorus, &ldquo;It felt like a bullet in his heart.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>Fiction, poetry, and philosophy have been full of similes for centuries. In
            fact, the oldest literature known to us uses similes, along with their close
            relatives known as metaphors (see metaphorical). This suggests that similes
            are an essential part of imaginative writing in all times and all cultures. When
            Tennyson, describing an eagle, writes &ldquo;And like a thunderbolt he falls,&rdquo; he's
            using a simile, since the line makes a specific comparison. &ldquo;The road was a
            ribbon of moonlight&rdquo; could be called a metaphor, though &ldquo;The road was like
            a ribbon of moonlight&rdquo; would be a simile.</p>

        <p>assimilate (1) To take in and thoroughly understand. (2) To
            cause to become part of a different society or culture.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; One of the traditional strengths of American society has been its ability to
            assimilate one group of immigrants after another.
        </p>
        <p>Assimilate comes from the Latin verb assimulare, &ldquo;to make similar,&rdquo; and it
            originally applied to the process by which food is taken into the body and
            absorbed into the system. In a similar way, a fact can be taken into the mind,
            thoroughly digested, and absorbed into one's store of knowledge. A
            newcomer to a job or a subject must assimilate an often confusing mass of
            information; only after it's been thoroughly absorbed can the person make
            intelligent use of it. An immigrant family assimilates into its new culture by
            gradually adopting a new language and the habits of their new neighbors&mdash;a
            process that's always easier for the children than for the parents.</p>

        <p>simulacrum A copy, especially a superficial likeness or
            imitation.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; As a boy he had filled his bedroom with model fighter jets, and these
            simulacra had kept his flying fantasies active for years.
        </p>
        <p>In its original meaning, a simulacrum is simply a representation of something
            else; so an original oil painting, marble statue, or plastic figurine could all be
            simulacra (notice the plural form) in the old sense. But today the word
            usually means a copy that's meant to substitute for the real thing&mdash;and
            usually a cheap and inferior copy, a pale imitation of the original. So in old
            Persia a beautifully laid out garden was a simulacrum of paradise. Some
            countries' governments are mere simulacra of democracy, since the people in
            power always steal the elections by miscounting the votes. And a bad actor
            might do a simulacrum of grief on the stage that doesn't convince anyone.</p>

        <p>simulate (1) To take on the appearance or effect of something,

            as a physical environment.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The armed services have made extensive use of video games to simulate the
            actual experience of warfare for their recruits.
        </p>
        <p>The zircon, that favorite of home shopping channels, simulates a diamond&mdash;
            more or less. A skilled furrier can dye lower-grade furs to simulate real mink.
            A skilled actress can simulate a range of emotions from absolute joy to
            crushing despair. And an apparatus that simulates the hazards of driving
            while intoxicated is likely to provide some very real benefits.</p>

        <p>SCEND comes from the Latin verb scandere, &ldquo;to climb.&rdquo; The staircase we

        <p>transcend To rise above the limits of; overcome, surpass.

        <p>&bull; His defeat in the election had been terribly hard on him, and it took two
            years before he finally felt he had transcended the bitterness it had produced.
        </p>
        <p>Great leaders are expected to transcend the limitations of politics, especially
            during wartime and national crises. A great writer may transcend
            geographical boundaries to become internationally respected. And certain
            laws of human nature seem to transcend historical periods and hold true for
            all times and all places.</p>

        <p>condescend (1) To stoop to a level of lesser importance or
            dignity. (2) To behave as if superior.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Every so often my big brother would condescend to take me to a movie, but
            only when my parents made him.
        </p>
        <p>Back when society was more rigidly structured, condescend didn't sound so
            negative. People of higher rank, power, or social position had to overlook
            certain established rules of behavior if they wished to have social dealings
            with people of lower status, but such condescension was usually gracious and
            courteous. In today's more classless society, the term implies a manner that
            may be slightly offensive. A poor relation is unlikely to be grateful to a
            wealthy and condescending relative who passes on her secondhand clothes,
            and employees at an office party may not be thrilled when the boss's wife
            condescends to mingle with them. Often the word is used rather unseriously,
            as when a friend comments that a snooty sales clerk condescended to wait on
            her after ignoring her for several minutes.</p>

        <p>descendant (1) One that has come down from another or
            from a common stock. (2) One deriving directly from a forerunner or
            original.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Though none of the great man's descendants ever came close to achieving
            what he had, most of them enjoyed very respectable careers.
        </p>
        <p>Descendant is the opposite of ancestor. Your grandparents' descendants are
            those who are descended from them&mdash;your parents, your brothers and sisters,
            and any children that any of you may have. It's been claimed that every
            person on earth is a descendant of Muhammad, and of every historical person
            before him&mdash;Julius Caesar, the Buddha, etc.&mdash;who started a line of descent.
            (Some of us still find this hard to believe.) And not all descendants are
            human; every modern thesaurus, for example, could be called the descendant
            of the one devised by Peter Mark Roget in 1852.</p>

        <p>ascendancy Governing or controlling interest; domination.

        <p>In the course of a year, the sun appears to pass through the twelve
            constellations of the zodiac in sequence, and all the planets also lie close to
            the solar path. The constellation and planet that are just rising, or ascendant,
            above the eastern horizon in the sun's path at the moment of a child's birth are
            said by astrologers to exercise a lifelong controlling influence over the child.
            This is the idea that lies at the heart of ascendancy, though the word today no

        <p>ONYM comes from the Greek onyma, meaning &ldquo;name, word.&rdquo; An
            anonymous donor or writer is one who isn't named. A synonym is a word with
            the same meaning as another word (see SYN). And homonyms (see
            HOM/HOMO) are words that look and sound alike but aren't actually related,
            such as well (&ldquo;healthy&rdquo;) and well (&ldquo;a deep hole with water in it&rdquo;).</p>

        <p>antonym A word that means the opposite of some other word.

            and sun isn't an antonym of moon.
        </p>
        <p>Antonym includes the Greek prefix ant-, meaning &ldquo;opposite&rdquo; (see
            ANT/ANTI). Antonyms are often thought of in pairs: hot/cold, up/down,
            wet/dry, buy/sell, failure/success. But a word may have more than one
            antonym (old/young, old/new), especially when one of the words has
            synonyms (small/large, small/big, little/big), and a word may have many
            approximate antonyms (adore/hate, adore/detest, adore/loathe). But although
            lots of words have synonyms, not so many have antonyms. What would be
            the antonym of pink? weather? semipro? thirty? firefighter? wax? about?

        <p>eponymous Of, relating to, or being the person for whom
            something is named.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Adjectives such as Elizabethan, Victorian, and Edwardian show how the
            names of certain British monarchs have become eponymous for particular
            time periods and styles.
        </p>
        <p>Things as different as a bird, a river, and a drug may be named to honor
            someone. The Canadian city of Vancouver was named after the explorer
            George Vancouver; the diesel engine was named for its inventor, Rudolph
            Diesel; Alzheimer's disease was named after the physician Alois Alzheimer;
            and so on. Common eponymous terms include Ohm's law, Parkinson's Law,
            and the Peter Principle. And if the Beatles' famous &ldquo;white album&rdquo; actually
            has a name, it's usually called &ldquo;The Beatles,&rdquo; which means that it's
            eponymous as well. Don't be surprised if eponymous turns out to be a hard
            word to use; lots of other people have discovered the same thing.</p>

        <p>patronymic Part of a personal name based on the name of
            one's father or one of his ancestors.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Reading Tolstoy's vast novel, it can be helpful to know that Helene
            Vasilievna's second name is a patronymic, and thus that her father is named
            Vasili.
        </p>
        <p>A patronymic, or patronym (see also PATER/PATR), is generally formed by
            adding a prefix or suffix to a name. Thus, a few centuries ago, the male
            patronymic of Patrick was Fitzpatrick (&ldquo;Patrick's son&rdquo;), that of Peter was
            Peterson or Petersen, that of Donald was MacDonald or McDonald, and that
            of Hernando was Hern&aacute;ndez. Today, of course, each of these is an ordinary
            family name, or surname. In Russia, both a patronymic and a surname are
            still used; in the name Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, for example, Ilyich is a
            patronymic meaning &ldquo;son of Ilya.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>pseudonym A name that someone (such as a writer) uses
            instead of his or her real name.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Hundreds of Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, and Bobbsey Twins novels were
            churned out under such pseudonyms as Franklin W. Dixon, Carolyn Keene,
            and Laura Lee Hope.
        </p>
        <p>The Greek pseudo- is used in English to mean &ldquo;false,&rdquo; or sometimes
            &ldquo;resembling.&rdquo; A pseudonym is thus a false name, or alias. A writer's
            pseudonym is called a pen name, as in the case of Howard O'Brien (who
            usually writes as &ldquo;Anne Rice&rdquo; but sometimes under other names), and an
            actor's pseudonym is called a stage name, as in the case of Marion Morrison
            (&ldquo;John Wayne&rdquo;). A cadre name may be used for the sake of secrecy by a

        <p>SCRIB/SCRIP comes from the Latin verb scribere, &ldquo;to write.&rdquo; Scribble is an
            old word meaning to write or draw carelessly. A written work that hasn't been
            published is a manuscript. And to describe is to picture something in words.</p>

        <p>conscription Enforced enlistment of persons, especially
            for military service; draft.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The first comprehensive system for nationwide conscription was instituted
            by France for the Napoleonic wars that followed the French Revolution.
        </p>
        <p>With its scrip- root, conscription means basically writing someone's name on
            a list&mdash;a list that, unfortunately, a lot of people usually don't want to be on.
            Conscription has existed at least since ancient Egypt's Old Kingdom (27th
            century B.C.), though universal conscription has been rare throughout
            history. Forms of conscription were used by Prussia, Switzerland, Russia, and
            other European powers in the 17th and 18th centuries. In the U.S.,
            conscription was first applied during the Civil War, by both the North and the
            South. In the North there were pockets of resistance, and the draft led to riots
            in several cities. The U.S. abandoned conscription at the end of the war and
            didn't revive it until World War I.</p>

        <p>circumscribe (1) To clearly limit the range or activity of
            something. (2) To draw a line around or to surround with a boundary.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Some children do best when their freedom is clearly circumscribed and their
            activities are supervised.
        </p>
        <p>The prefix circum-, &ldquo;around,&rdquo; is the key to circumscribe's basic meaning.
            Thus, we could say that a boxing ring is circumscribed by ropes, just as the
            area for an archaeological dig may be. A governor's power is always
            circumscribed by a state's constitution. And a physician's assistant has a
            circumscribed role that doesn't include writing prescriptions.</p>

        <p>inscription (1) Something permanently written, engraved,

            The dedication of a book or work of art.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; All U.S. coins bear the Latin inscription &ldquo;E pluribus unum&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;From many,
            one.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>With its prefix in-, meaning &ldquo;in&rdquo; or &ldquo;on,&rdquo; it's not surprising that an inscription
            is either written on or engraved into a surface. Inscriptions in the ancient
            world were always chiseled into stone, as inscriptions still may be today. The
            principal monument of the Vietnam memorial in Washington, D.C., for
            instance, is a black wall on which are inscribed the names of all the
            Americans who died during the war&mdash;each name in full, row upon seemingly
            endless row. But an inscription may also be a dedication, such as the words
            &ldquo;For my wife&rdquo; all by themselves on a page near the beginning of a book.</p>

        <p>proscribe To forbid as harmful or unlawful; prohibit.

        <p>&bull; Despite thousands of laws proscribing littering, many of America's streets
            and public spaces continue to be dumping grounds.
        </p>
        <p>The Latin prefix pro- sometimes meant &ldquo;before,&rdquo; in the sense of &ldquo;in front of&rdquo;
            the people. So in ancient Rome proscribere meant to make public in writing
            the name of a person who was about to be executed, and whose property
            would be seized by the state. But the meaning of the English word soon
            shifted to mean simply &ldquo;prohibit&rdquo; instead. Proscribe today is actually often
            the opposite of the very similar prescribe, which means basically &ldquo;require.&rdquo;</p>

            though that meaning does show up in older phrases: &ldquo;Thou shalt not bear

        <p>Philosophers are constantly using the word fallacy. For them, a fallacy is
            reasoning that comes to a conclusion without the evidence to support it. This
            may have to do with pure logic, with the assumptions that the argument is
            based on, or with the way words are used, especially if they don't keep
            exactly the same meaning throughout the argument. There are many classic
            fallacies that occur again and again through the centuries and everywhere in
            the world. You may have heard of such fallacies as the &ldquo;ad hominem&rdquo;
            fallacy, the &ldquo;question-begging&rdquo; fallacy, the &ldquo;straw man&rdquo; fallacy, the
            &ldquo;slippery
            slope&rdquo; fallacy, the &ldquo;gambler's&rdquo; fallacy, or the &ldquo;red herring&rdquo; fallacy. Look

            But it's used widely in writing, especially when one writer is arguing with
            another. And it's used to describe both errors in fact and errors in reasoning,

            most familiar with the fallibility of memory, especially when we remember
            something clearly that turns out never to have happened. Being fallible is part

            Catholic church, adopted in the 19th century, that certain solemn statements
            made by a Pope about faith or morals were not to be questioned. Popes since

        <p>SOLU comes from the Latin verb solvere, &ldquo;to loosen, free, release,&rdquo; and the
            root therefore may take the form solv- as well. So to solve a problem means
            to find its solution, as if you were freeing up a logjam. And a solvent is a
            chemical that dissolves or &ldquo;loosens up&rdquo; oil or paint.</p>

            it's often used by nonchemists as well to describe substances that can be
            dissolved in liquids. On the other hand, the sense of soluble meaning
            &ldquo;solvable&rdquo; is also quite common. In this sense, soluble, like its opposite,
            insoluble, is usually paired with problem. If only all life's problems were

            from the priest.
        </p>
        <p>Since the Latin absolutus meant &ldquo;set free,&rdquo; it's easy to see how absolution
            came to mean &ldquo;set free from sin.&rdquo; (And also easy to see why absolute means
            basically &ldquo;pure&rdquo;&mdash;that is, originally, &ldquo;free of sin.&rdquo;) The verb for absolution
            is
            absolve. Just as a priest absolves believers of their sins, you may absolve
            your brother of blame for a household disaster, or you yourself may in time
            be absolved for that scrape on the car backing out of a parking space.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Dissolution is the noun form of dissolve, but it's a much less common word.
            Still, we refer to the fact that the dissolution of American marriages became
            far more common in the later 20th century. Or that when India won its
            independence in 1948, the dissolution of the once-global British empire was
            all but complete. Or that factors such as crime and drugs might be
            contributing to the dissolution of contemporary society's moral fabric. A
            dissolute person is someone in whom all restraint has dissolved, and who
            now indulges in behavior that shocks decent people.</p>

        <p>Resolute comes from the same Latin verb as resolved, and the two words are
            often synonyms. So how did it get this meaning from the Latin? Essentially,
            when you resolve a question or problem, you come to a conclusion, and once
            you've reached a conclusion you can proceed to act. So in your New Year's
            resolutions, you resolve&mdash;or make up your mind&mdash;to do something.
            Unfortunately, New Year's resolutions aren't a good illustration of the

            mouth. Dehydrate can also be used for making something &ldquo;dry&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifeless&rdquo;;
            thus, a dull teacher can dehydrate American history, and an unimaginative
            staging can dehydrate a great Shakespeare play.</p>

        <p>hydroelectric Having to do with the production of
            electricity by waterpower.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; A massive African hydroelectric project is creating the world's largest
            manmade lake, and is said to hold the key to the future for the country.
        </p>
        <p>The prime component of most hydroelectric systems is a dam. A high dam
            funnels water downward at high pressure to spin turbines, which in turn drive
            generators to produce high-voltage electricity. Mountainous countries with
            rushing rivers can produce the most hydroelectricity. Though hydroelectricity
            comes from a clean and completely renewable energy source, dams disrupt
            natural systems in a way that disturbs environmentalists.</p>

        <p>hydroponics The growing of plants in nutrient solutions,
            with or without supporting substances such as sand or gravel.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; He had never thought hydroponics produced vegetables as tasty as those
            grown in soil, and the tomatoes seemed particularly disappointing.
        </p>
        <p>Hydroponics, also known as aquaculture or tank farming, began as a way of
            studying scientifically the mechanisms of plant nutrition. Hydroponically
            grown plants may have no solid material under them at all; instead, their
            roots often simply hang in water with a rich mix of nutrients dissolved in it.
            The principal advantage to hydroponics is the savings from reduced labor
            costs, since it's generally carried on in enclosed areas and the irrigation and
            fertilizing are done mechanically. Peppers, cucumbers, and various other
            vegetables are produced hydroponically in huge quantities.</p>

        <p>aegis (1) Something that protects or defends; shield. (2) Sponsorship

        <p>&bull; The conference was held under the aegis of the World Affairs Council,
            which provided almost all of the funding.
        </p>
        <p>The original aegis was a goatskin shield or breastplate, symbolizing majesty,
            that was worn by Zeus and his daughter Athena in Greek mythology.
            Athena's aegis bore the severed head of the monstrous Medusa. Aegis came to
            be used for any kind of invulnerable shield. But today we almost always use
            the word in the phrase &ldquo;under the aegis of . . . ,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;under the

        <p>charisma (1) An extraordinary gift for leadership that attracts

            magnetism.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Many later leaders have envied the charisma of Napoleon Bonaparte, who
            many of his followers genuinely believed to be immortal.
        </p>
        <p>Charisma is Greek for &ldquo;gift,&rdquo; but its traditional meaning comes from
            Christian belief, where it originally referred to an extraordinary power&mdash;the
            gift of healing, the gift of tongues, or the gift of prophecy&mdash;bestowed on an
            individual by the Holy Spirit. The first nonreligious use of charisma didn't
            appear until the 20th century, when it was applied to that mysterious personal
            magnetism that a lucky few seem to possess, especially the magnetism with
            which a political leader can arouse great popular enthusiasm. When John F.
            Kennedy was elected president in 1960, its use by journalists popularized the
            term in the mass media. Since then, actors, rock stars, athletes, generals, and
            entrepreneurs have all been said to possess charisma.</p>

        <p>ego (1) A sense of confidence and satisfaction in oneself; self-esteem.

        <p>&bull; His raging ego was what his fellow lawyers remembered about him&mdash;his
            tantrums, his vanity, his snobbery, and all the rest of it.
        </p>
        <p>Ego is the Latin word for &ldquo;I.&ldquo; So if a person seems to begin every sentence
            with &ldquo;I,&rdquo; it's sometimes a sign of a big ego. It was the psychologist Sigmund
            Freud (well, actually his original translator) who put ego into the popular
            vocabulary, but what he meant by the word is complex, so only other
            psychologists really use it in the Freudian sense. The rest of us generally use
            ego simply to mean one's sense of self-worth, whether exaggerated or not.
            When used in the &ldquo;exaggerated&rdquo; sense, ego is almost the same thing as
            conceit. Meeting a superstar athlete without a trace of this kind of ego would
            be a most refreshing experience. But having a reasonable sense of your own
            worth is no sin. Life's little everyday victories are good&mdash;in fact, necessary&mdash;
            for a healthy ego.</p>

        <p>ethos The features, attitudes, moral code, or basic beliefs that
            define a person, a group, or an institution.

        <p>&bull; The company's ethos has always been an interesting blend of greed and
            generosity.
        </p>
        <p>Ethos means &ldquo;custom&rdquo; or &ldquo;character&rdquo; in Greek. As originally used by
            Aristotle, it referred to a man's character or personality, especially in its
            balance between passion and caution. Today ethos is used to refer to the
            practices or values that distinguish one person, organization, or society from
            others. So we often hear of the ethos of rugged individualism and self-
            sufficiency on the American frontier in the 19th century; and a critic might
            complain about, for example, the ethos of violence in the inner cities or the
            ethos of permissiveness in the suburbs.</p>

        <p>To the Greeks, hubris referred to extreme pride, especially pride and
            ambition so great that they offend the gods and lead to one's downfall. Hubris
            was a character flaw often seen in the heroes of classical Greek tragedy,
            including Oedipus and Achilles. The familiar old saying &ldquo;Pride goeth before
            a fall&rdquo; is basically talking about hubris.</p>

        <p>id The part of a person's unconscious mind that relates to basic needs

        </p>
        <p>&bull; His own id often scared him, especially when a sudden violent impulse
            would well up out of nowhere.
        </p>
        <p>In Latin, id means simply &ldquo;it.&rdquo; Sigmund Freud (and his translator) brought
            the word into the modern vocabulary as the name of what Freud believed to
            be one of the three basic elements of the human personality, the other two
            being the ego (see ego) and the superego. According to Freud, the id is the
            first of these to develop, and is the home of the body's basic instincts,
            particularly those involving sex and aggression. Since the id lacks logic,
            reason, or even organization, it can contain conflicting impulses. Primitive in
            nature, it wants to be satisfied immediately. Although its workings are
            completely unconscious, Freud believed that its contents could be revealed in
            works of art, in slips of the tongue (&ldquo;Freudian slips&rdquo;), and in one's dreams.</p>

            libido had led him this time.
        </p>
        <p>The Latin word libido, meaning &ldquo;desire, lust,&rdquo; was borrowed by Sigmund
            Freud as the name for a concept in his own theories. At first he defined libido
            to mean the instinctual energy associated with the sex drive. Later he
            broadened the word's meaning and began using it to mean the mental energy
            behind purposeful human activity of any kind; in other words, the libido (for
            which Freud also used the term eros, a Greek word meaning &ldquo;sexual love&rdquo;)
            came to be regarded as the life instinct, which included sex along with all the
            other impulses we rely on to keep us alive. But those of us who aren't
            psychologists use the word simply as a synonym for &ldquo;sex drive.&rdquo;</p>

        </p>
        <p>Trauma is the Greek word for &ldquo;wound.&rdquo; Although the Greeks used the term
            only for physical injuries, nowadays trauma is just as likely to refer to
            emotional wounds. We now know that a traumatic event can leave
            psychological symptoms long after any physical injuries have healed. The
            psychological reaction to emotional trauma now has an established name:
            post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. It usually occurs after an extremely
            stressful event, such as wartime combat, a natural disaster, or sexual or
            physical abuse; its symptoms include depression, anxiety, flashbacks, and
            recurring nightmares.</p>

        <p>MUR from the Latin noun murus, meaning &ldquo;wall,&rdquo; has produced a modest
            number of English words.</p>

        <p>muralist A painter of wall paintings.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; She's enjoying her new career as a muralist, but it's terribly hard on her
            when she sees her works wrecked by vandals.
        </p>
        <p>Any wall painting may be called a mural. Murals have been around since
            long before the framed painting. Scenic murals date back to at least 2000
            B.C. on the island of Crete. Indoor murals for private homes were popular in
            ancient Greece and Rome, and many of those at Pompeii were preserved by
            the lava of Mt. Vesuvius. In the Renaissance the muralists Raphael and
            Michelangelo created great wall and ceiling paintings for the Catholic
            Church, and Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper became one of the most
            famous of all murals. Mural painting saw a great revival in Mexico beginning
            in the 1920s, when a group of muralists inspired by the Mexican Revolution,
            including Diego Rivera, J. C. Orozco, and D. A. Siqueiros, began taking their
            intensely political art to the public by creating giant wall paintings,
            sometimes on outdoor surfaces.</p>

        <p>intramural Existing or occurring within the bounds of an
            institution, especially a school.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; At college he lacked the time to go out for sports in a serious way, but he
            did play intramural hockey all four years.
        </p>
        <p>With its Latin prefix intra-, &ldquo;within&rdquo; (not to be confused with inter-,
            &ldquo;between&rdquo;), intramural means literally &ldquo;within the walls.&rdquo; The word is
            usually used for sports played between teams made up only from students at
            one campus. Intramural athletics is often the most popular extracurricular
            activity at a college or university.</p>
        <p />
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <p />
        <p>extramural Existing outside or beyond the walls or
            boundaries of an organized unit such as a school or hospital.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; &ldquo;Hospital Without Walls&rdquo; is an extramural program that offers home health-
            care services.
        </p>
        <p>Extramural contains the Latin extra-, meaning &ldquo;outside&rdquo; or &ldquo;beyond&rdquo; (see
            EXTRA). The walls in extramural are usually those of schools, colleges, and
            universities, and the word is often seen in phrases like &ldquo;extramural activities&rdquo;
            and &ldquo;extramural competition,&rdquo; referring to things that involve the world
            beyond the campus. Some institutions use the term &ldquo;extramural study&rdquo; for
            what others call &ldquo;distance learning&rdquo;&mdash;that is, teaching and learning by means
            of Web connections to the classroom and to videos of lectures. Money that
            flows into universities to support research (from foundations, government
            institutes, etc.) is usually called &ldquo;extramural income.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>immure To enclose within, or as if within, walls; imprison.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In Dumas's famous novel, the Count of Monte Cristo is in fact a sailor who
            had been unjustly immured in an island prison for 15 years before breaking
            out and taking his revenge.
        </p>
        <p>In Eastern European legend, whenever a large bridge or fort was completed, a
            young maiden would be immured in the stonework as a sacrifice. (It's not
            certain that such things were actually done.) In Poe's grim story &ldquo;A Cask of
            Amontillado,&rdquo; a man achieves revenge on a fellow nobleman by chaining
            him to a cellar wall and bricking him up alive. At the end of Verdi's great
            opera Aida, Aida joins her lover so that they can die immured together. But
            real-life examples of immurement as a final punishment are somewhat harder
            to find.</p>

        <p>POLIS/POLIT comes from the Greek word for &ldquo;city.&rdquo; The ancient Greek
            city-states, such as Athens, Thebes, and Sparta, operated much like separate
            nations, so all their politics was local, like all their public policy&mdash;and even
            all their police!</p>
        <p />
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <p />
        <p>politic (1) Cleverly tactful. (2) Wise in promoting a plan or plan
            of action.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Anger is rarely a politic way to seek agreement, since it usually comes
            across as rude and self-righteous.
        </p>
        <p>Politic behavior in class always requires a respectful attitude toward your
            teacher. It's never politic to ask for a raise when your boss is in a terrible
            mood. And once teenagers learn to drive, they quickly learn the politic way to
            ask for the car&mdash;that is, whatever gets the keys without upsetting the parents.
            As you can see, politic can be used for many situations that have nothing to
            do with public politics.</p>
        <p />
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <p />
        <p>politicize To give a political tone or character to.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; By 1968 the Vietnam War had deeply politicized most of America's college
            campuses.
        </p>
        <p>Sexual harassment was once seen as a private matter, but in the 1980s and
            '90s it became thoroughly politicized, with women loudly pressuring
            lawmakers to make it illegal. So, at the same time, the issue of sexual
            harassment politicized many women, who began to take an interest in
            political action because of it. In other words, we may speak of an issue
            becoming politicized, but also of a person or group becoming politicized.</p>

        <p>acropolis The high, fortified part of a city, especially an
            ancient Greek city.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; On the Athenian Acropolis, high above the rest of the city, stands the
            Parthenon, a temple to Athena.
        </p>
        <p>The Greek root acro- means &ldquo;high&rdquo;; thus, an acropolis is basically a &ldquo;high
            city.&rdquo; Ancient cities often grew up around a high point, in order that they
            could easily be defended. The Greeks and Romans usually included in their
            acropolises temples to the city's most important gods; so, for example, Athens
            built a great temple on its Acropolis to its protector goddess, Athena, from
            which the city took its name. Many later European cities cluster around a
            walled castle on a height, into which the population of the city and the
            surrounding area could retreat in case of attack, and even South American
            cities often contain a similar walled area on high ground.</p>

        <p>megalopolis (1) A very large city. (2) A thickly
            populated area that includes one or more cities with the surrounding suburbs.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; With its rapid development, the southern coast of Florida around Miami
            quickly became a megalopolis.
        </p>
        <p>A &ldquo;large city&rdquo; named Megalopolis was founded in Greece in 371 B.C. to help
            defend the region called Arcadia against the city-state of Sparta. Though a
            stadium seating 20,000 was built there, indicating the city's impressive size
            for its time, Megalopolis today has only about 5,000 people. Social scientists
            now identify 10 megalopolises in the U.S., each with more than 10 million
            people. The one on the eastern seaboard that stretches from Boston to
            Washington, D.C., where the densely populated cities seem to flow into each
            other all along the coast, is now home to over 50 million people. But it's
            easily surpassed by the Japanese megalopolis that includes Tokyo, with more
            than 80 million inhabitants.</p>

        <p>NUMER comes from the Latin words meaning &ldquo;number&rdquo; and &ldquo;to count.&rdquo; A
            numeral is the symbol that represents a number. Numerous means &ldquo;many,&rdquo;
            and innumerable means &ldquo;countless.&rdquo; Numerical superiority is superiority in

        </p>
        <p>As an element of astrology and fortune-telling, numerology has long been
            employed to predict future events. For many early Christians, 3 represented
            the Trinity, 6 represented earthly perfection, and 7 represented heavenly
            perfection; and still today, many of us like to group things into sets of 3 or 7,
            for no particular reason. Numerology has also been used to interpret
            personality; in particular, numerologists may assign numbers to each letter of
            a person's name and use the resulting figures, along with the person's date of
            birth, as a guide to his or her character.</p>

        <p>alphanumeric Having or using both letters and numbers.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Back in the 1950s, we always spoke our phone numbers in alphanumeric
            form, using the letters printed on the dial: for example, &ldquo;TErrace 5-6642,&rdquo;
            instead of &ldquo;835-6642.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>Alphanumeric passwords are much harder for a hacker to crack than plain
            alphabetic passwords, since the number of possible combinations is so much
            greater. License plates usually contain both letters and numbers, since, for a
            big state or country, the plate wouldn't be large enough to fit enough numbers
            for everyone. In computing, the standard alphanumeric codes, such as ASCII,
            may contain not only ordinary letters and numerals but also punctuation
            marks and math symbols.</p>

            out loud, while he would sit scowling into the newspaper trying to ignore her.
        </p>
        <p>In a census year, the U.S. government attempts to enumerate every single
            citizen of the country&mdash;a task that, even in the modern era of technology, isn't
            truly possible. Medical tests often require the enumeration of bacteria,
            viruses, or other organisms to determine the progress of a disease or the
            effectiveness of a medication. Despite its numer- root, you don't have to use
            numbers when enumerating. For students of government and law, the
            &ldquo;enumerated powers&rdquo; are the specific responsibilities of the Congress, as
            listed in the U.S. Constitution; these are the only powers that Congress has, a
            fact that the Tenth Amendment makes even more clearly.</p>

            supernumerary fingers, or supernumerary toes. A supernumerary rainbow
            may show up as a faint line&mdash;red, green, or purple&mdash;just touching the main

        <p>KILO is the French version of the Greek word chilioi, meaning &ldquo;thousand.&rdquo;
            France is also where the metric system originated, in the years following the
            French Revolution. So in English, kilo- shows up chiefly in metric-system
            units. Before the computer age, the most familiar kilo- words for English-
            speakers were probably kilowatt, meaning &ldquo;1,000 watts,&rdquo; and kilowatt-hour,
            meaning the amount of energy equal to one kilowatt over the course of an
            hour.</p>

        <p>&bull; A 200-word paragraph in the simplest text format takes up about a kilobyte
            of storage space on your hard drive.
        </p>
        <p>Knowing the root kilo-, you might think a kilobyte would be exactly 1,000
            bytes. But actually a kilobyte represents the power of 2 that comes closest to
            1,000: that is, 210 (2 to the 10th power), or 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 2
            &times; 2 &times; 2 &times;
            2, or 1,024. Why 2? Because the capacity of memory chips is always based
            on powers of 2. Locations in electronic memory circuits are identified by
            binary numbers (numbers that use only the digits 0 and 1), so the number of
            addressable locations becomes a power of 2.</p>

        <p>kilometer A unit of length equal to 1,000 meters.

        <p>&bull; U.S. highway signs near the Canadian border often show distances in
            kilometers in addition to miles.
        </p>
        <p>A kilometer is equal to about 62/100 of a mile, and a mile is equal to about
            1.61 kilometers. The U.S. has been slow to adopt metric measures, which are
            used almost everywhere else in the world. Though our car speedometers are
            often marked in both miles and kilometers, the U.S. and Great Britain are
            practically the only developed nations that still show miles rather than
            kilometers on their road signs. But even in the U.S., footraces are usually
            measured in meters or kilometers, like the Olympic races. Runners normally
            abbreviate kilometer to K: &ldquo;a 5K race&rdquo; (3.1 miles), &ldquo;the 10K run&rdquo; (6.2 miles),

        </p>
        <p>If your favorite AM radio station has a frequency of 680 kilohertz (kHz), that
            means the station's transmitter is oscillating (vibrating) at a rate of 680,000
            cycles per second (i.e., 680,000 times a second). A related term is megahertz
            (MHz), meaning &ldquo;millions of cycles per second.&rdquo; Shortwave radio operates
            between 5.9 and 26.1 MHz, and the FM radio band operates between 88 and
            108 MHz. Garage-door openers work at about 40 MHz, baby monitors work
            at 49 MHz, and so on. The terms hertz, kilohertz and megahertz honor the
            great German physicist Heinrich Hertz, the first person to broadcast and

        <p>kilogram A unit of weight equal to 1,000 grams.

        <p>&bull; The kilogram is the only base unit of measurement still defined by a
            physical object rather than a physical constant (such as the speed of light).
        </p>
        <p>The original concept of the kilogram, as the mass of a cubic decimeter of
            water (a bit more than a quart), was adopted as the base unit of mass by the
            new revolutionary government of France in 1793. In 1875, in the Treaty of
            the Meter, 17 countries, including the U.S., adopted the French kilogram as
            an international standard. In 1889 a new international standard for the
            kilogram, a metal bar made of platinum iridium, was agreed to; President
            Benjamin Harrison officially received the 1-kilogram cylinder for the U.S. in
            1890. But no one uses that bar very often; for all practical purposes, a
            kilogram equals 2.2 pounds.</p>

        <p>MICRO from the Greek mikros, meaning &ldquo;small,&rdquo; is a popular English
            prefix. A microscope lets the eye see microscopic objects, and libraries store
            the pages of old newspapers on microfilm at 1/400th of their original size.
            And we continue to attach micro- to lots of familiar words; most of us could
            figure out the meaning of microbus and microquake without ever having
            heard them before. Scientists often use micro- to mean &ldquo;millionth&rdquo;; thus, a
            microsecond is a millionth of a second, and a micrometer is a millionth of a
            meter.</p>

        <p>&bull; Vaccines reduce the risk of diseases by using dead or greatly weakened
            microbes to stimulate the immune system.
        </p>
        <p>A hint of the Greek word bios, meaning &ldquo;life,&rdquo; can be seen in microbe.
            Microbes, or microorganisms, include bacteria, protozoa, fungi, algae,
            amoebas, and slime molds. Many people think of microbes as simply the
            causes of disease, but every human is actually the host to billions of
            microbes, and most of them are essential to our life. Much research is now
            going into possible microbial sources of future energy; algae looks
            particularly promising, as do certain newly discovered or created microbes
            that can produce cellulose, to be turned into ethanol and other biofuels.</p>

        <p>microbiologist A scientist who studies extremely

        <p>&bull; Food microbiologists study the tiny organisms that cause spoiling and
            foodborne illness.
        </p>
        <p>Since microorganisms are involved in almost every aspect of life on earth,
            microbiologists work across a broad range of subject areas. Some study only
            viruses, some only bacteria. A marine microbiologist studies the roles of
            microbial communities in the sea. A soil microbiologist might focus on the
            use and spread of nitrogen. Veterinary microbiologists might research
            bacteria that attack racehorses or diagnose anthrax in cows. And the
            government puts microbiologists to work studying whether microbes could
            adapt to life on the surface of Mars, and how to defend ourselves against the
            possibility of germ warfare.</p>

        <p>microbrew A beer made by a brewery that makes beer in
            small amounts.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; As a city of 75,000 people with eight breweries, it offers a greater variety of
            microbrews per capita than any other place in America.
        </p>
        <p>Microbrews are usually beers or ales made with special malts and hops,
            unfiltered and unpasteurized, and thus distinctive in their aroma and flavor.
            Many microbreweries double as bar/restaurants, called brewpubs, where the
            gleaming vats may be visible behind a glass partition. &ldquo;Craft brewing&rdquo; and
            the opening of local brewpubs began in earnest in the U.S. in the 1980s. But
            not everyone is willing to pay extra for a beer, and lots of people are simply
            used to the blander taste of the best-selling beers, so by 2008 microbrews still
            only accounted for about 4% of all beer sold in the U.S.</p>

        <p>microclimate The essentially uniform local climate of a

        </p>
        <p>&bull; Temperature, light, wind speed, and moisture are the essential components
            of a microclimate.
        </p>
        <p>The microclimate of an industrial park may be quite different from that of a
            nearby wooded park, since the plants absorb light and heat while asphalt
            parking lots and rooftops radiate them back into the air. A microclimate can
            offer a small growing area for crops that wouldn't do well in the wider region,
            so skilled gardeners take advantage of microclimates by carefully choosing
            and positioning their plants. San Francisco's hills, oceanfront, and bay shore,
            along with its alternating areas of concrete and greenery, make it a city of
            microclimates.</p>

        <p>MULTI comes from the Latin word multus, meaning &ldquo;many.&rdquo; Thus, a
            multicultural society is one that includes people of several different countries,
            languages, and religions; a multimedia artwork uses two or more artistic
            media (dance, music, film, spoken text, etc.); and a multitude of complaints

        <p>&bull; Multicellular organisms&mdash;fungi, plants, and animals&mdash;have specialized cells
            that perform different functions.
        </p>
        <p>Multicellular organisms are distinguished from the very primitive single-
            celled organisms&mdash;bacteria, algae, amoebas, etc. Even sponges, simple as
            they are, have specialized cell types such as digestive cells. In complex
            multicellular organisms, only the surface cells can exchange substances with
            the external environment, so the organisms have developed transport systems
            such as the circulatory system, in which the blood brings gases and nutrients
            to the cells and removes waste products from them.</p>

        <p>multidisciplinary Involving two or more

        </p>
        <p>&bull; Her favorite class was Opera, a multidisciplinary class taught jointly by a
            music professor and a literature professor.
        </p>
        <p>A discipline is a field of study. So a multidisciplinary (or interdisciplinary)
            course is a team-taught course in which students are asked to understand a
            single subject as it's seen by two or more traditional disciplines.
            Multidisciplinary teaching can open students' eyes to different views of a
            subject that they had never considered before. A multidisciplinary panel
            discussion, on the other hand, presents views from scholars in different fields
            but may leave any merging of the information to the audience.</p>

        <p>multifarious Having or occurring in great variety;
            diverse.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Natives put the coconut palm to multifarious uses: using the nuts for eating,
            the juice for drinking, the wood for building huts, the leaves for thatch, the
            fiber for mats, and the shells for utensils.
        </p>
        <p>Multifarious is a rather grand word, probably not for everyday use, but when
            you want to emphasize great variety&mdash;such as the huge number of uses to
            which a state-of-the-art cell phone can be put&mdash;it can be effective. Dictionary
            fans are constantly amazed by the multifarious meanings of the word set (47
            of them in one unabridged dictionary), and thesaurus lovers may marvel at
            the multifarious synonyms for drunk.</p>

        <p>multilateral Involving more than two nations or parties.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; A couple of times a year, representatives of the large industrial democracies
            meet for a round of multilateral trade negotiations.
        </p>
        <p>Since lateral means &ldquo;side&rdquo; (see LATER), multilateral means basically
            &ldquo;many-sided.&rdquo; The philosophy of multilateralism claims that the best
            solutions generally result when as many of the world's nations as possible are
            involved in discussions, and multilateralists often favor strengthening the
            United Nations. Today multilateralism can be seen at work in, for example,
            the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization, and the
            International Criminal Court. But the U.S. doesn't always join the major
            multilateral organizations, instead often behaving as if a unilateral approach
            &mdash;that is, going it alone&mdash;was best for the interests of a powerful nation.</p>

        <p>PAR from the Latin, means &ldquo;equal.&rdquo; Our English word par means an
            amount taken as an average or a standard, and especially the standard score
            for each hole on a golf course&mdash;which is why the phrase &ldquo;par for the course&rdquo;
            means &ldquo;about as well as expected.&rdquo; We compare things to see if they're
            equal; similar things can be called comparable&mdash;that is, &ldquo;equal with.&rdquo; And

        <p>Parity has special meanings in such fields as physics, math, medicine,
            genetics, and marketing. Back when the Soviet Union and the U.S. were
            opposing superpowers, there was often talk of parity in nuclear weapons
            between the two sides. We sometimes hear about parity between mental and
            physical health in insurance coverage, or parity in colleges' funding of men's
            and women's athletics. But parity may be most common in discussions of
            currencies. The exchange rate between two national currencies often changes
            every day, as each drifts higher or lower, and occasionally two similar
            currencies, such as the euro and the U.S. dollar, will achieve parity, but it
            rarely lasts long.</p>

            was claiming and what he saw happening all around him.
        </p>
        <p>Disparity contains the Latin dis, meaning &ldquo;apart&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-&rdquo; (see DIS), so a
            disparity is a kind of &ldquo;nonequality.&rdquo; The word is often used to describe a
            social or economic condition that's considered unfairly unequal: a racial
            disparity in hiring, a health disparity between the rich and the poor, an
            income disparity between men and women, and so on. Its adjective, disparate

        <p>PHOB comes from the Greek noun phobos, &ldquo;fear,&rdquo; and it shows up clearly in
            our noun phobia, meaning &ldquo;unusual fear of a specific thing.&rdquo; Phobias vary
            greatly in seriousness and also in frequency. Most of us have experienced
            claustrophobia at some time, but few truly suffer from fear of the number 13,

        <p>The Greek akron means &ldquo;height&rdquo; or &ldquo;summit,&rdquo; and the acro- root can be seen
            in such words as acrobat and Acropolis. Almost everyone has some fear of
            heights, but an abnormal dread of high places, along with the vertigo
            (dizziness) that most acrophobes also experience, are common as well; in
            fact, acrophobia is one of the half-dozen most common recognized phobias.
            Acrophobia and claustrophobia both play a role in another well-known

            being in shops, or even fear of being in open spaces, or fear of traveling
            alone. It may also be a fear of experiencing some uncontrollable or
            embarrassing event (like fainting) in the presence of others with no help
            available. Agoraphobia can be hard to understand for those who don't suffer
            from it, especially because it can take so many different forms, but it is often
            a serious and socially crippling condition.</p>

        <p>xenophobe One who has a fear or hatred of strangers or
            foreigners.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; A Middle Easterner reading the U.S.'s visa restrictions might feel that the
            State Department was run by xenophobes.
        </p>
        <p>Xenophobe is partly based on the Greek noun xenos, meaning &ldquo;stranger,
            guest, foreigner.&rdquo; Unlike other phobias, xenophobia isn't really considered an
            abnormal condition; instead, it's generally thought of as just serious narrow-
            mindedness, the kind of thinking that goes along with racism and extreme
            patriotism. In times of war, a government will often actually try to turn all its
            citizens into xenophobes.</p>

        <p>arachnophobia Having a fear or dislike of spiders.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; At 50, my sister still suffers from arachnophobia, and can't sleep in a room
            unless she knows it has no spiders.
        </p>
        <p>In Greek mythology, Arachne was a weaver of such skill that she dared to
            challenge the goddess Athena at her craft. When she won their competition
            by weaving a tapestry disrespectful to the gods, the enraged Athena tore it to
            shreds, and in despair Arachne hanged herself. Out of pity, Athena loosened
            the rope, which became a cobweb, and changed Arachne into a spider.
            Today, the spiders, scorpions, mites, and ticks all belong to the class known
            as arachnids. Arachnophobia is the most common of the animal phobias; but
            many people suffer from similar phobias regarding snakes (ophidiophobia),
            dogs (cynophobia), and mice and rats (musophobia).</p>

        <p>HEM/HEMO comes from the Greek word for &ldquo;blood&rdquo; and is found at the
            beginning of many medical terms. By dropping the h-, the same word
            produced the suffix -emia, which likewise shows up in lots of &ldquo;blood&rdquo; words,
            including anemia, leukemia and hyperglycemia.</p>

        <p>hemorrhage (1) A large loss of blood from a blood vessel. (2) A
            rapid and uncontrollable loss or outflow.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; He arrived at the emergency room reporting headache, nausea, and
            drowsiness, and the doctor immediately suspected that he'd suffered a brain
            hemorrhage.
        </p>
        <p>A hemorrhage usually results from either a severe blow to the body or from
            medication being taken for something else. Though many hemorrhages aren't
            particularly serious, those that occur in the brain (cerebral hemorrhages) can
            be life-threatening. In older people, hemorrhages are often caused by blood-
            thinning medication taken to prevent heart attacks. A bruise (or hematoma) is
            a hemorrhage close enough to the surface of the skin to be visible.
            Hemorrhage is also a verb, which isn't always used to talk about actual
            blood; thus, we may hear that a business is hemorrhaging money, or that the
            U.S. has been hemorrhaging industrial jobs for decades. Be careful when
            writing hemorrhage; it's not an easy word to spell.</p>

        <p>hematology The study of blood and blood-forming

        <p>&bull; Her specialty in hematology let her work with patients of all ages and types,
            since blood problems may affect almost anyone.
        </p>
        <p>Blood is basic to almost all the body's functions, and a blood test can reveal
            more about your physical condition than almost any other kind of
            examination, so hematology is an important medical specialty, with many
            separate subjects. Since blood cells are formed in the bone marrow, the bones
            are one important focus for hematologists. The coagulation, or thickening, of
            the blood is another important subject, since coagulation is what keeps us
            from bleeding to death from even small wounds. And there are dozens of
            serious blood diseases, including anemia (a lack of red blood cells) and
            leukemia (cancer involving a buildup of white blood cells).</p>

        <p>hemophilia A bleeding disorder caused by the blood's
            inability to coagulate.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; When he was a child, his hemophilia had kept him from joining the other
            kids in rough play at recess.
        </p>
        <p>The dreaded disease known as hemophilia is the result of an inherited gene,
            and almost always strikes boys rather than girls (though mothers may pass
            the gene to their sons). Since the blood lacks an ingredient that causes it to
            clot or coagulate when a blood vessel breaks, even a minor wound can cause
            a hemophiliac to bleed to death if not treated. Bleeding can be particularly
            dangerous when it's entirely internal, with no visible wound, since the person
            may not be aware it's happening. Queen Victoria transmitted the hemophilia
            gene to royal families all across Europe; the hemophilia of a young Russian
            prince played a part in the downfall of the Russian czars. Today,
            hemophiliacs take drugs that stop the bleeding by speeding coagulation, and
            hemophiliac life expectancies in developed countries are almost as long as
            the average.</p>

        <p>hemoglobin The element in blood that transports oxygen

            tissues back to the lungs.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Her doctor had noticed her low hemoglobin count and was insisting that she
            include more iron-rich vegetables in her diet.
        </p>
        <p>When filled with oxygen, the hemoglobin in your blood is bright red;
            returning to the lungs without its oxygen, it loses its brightness and becomes
            somewhat bluish. Hemoglobin levels can change from day to day, and may
            be affected by such factors as a lack of iron in the diet, a recent loss of blood,
            and being pregnant. When you give blood, a nurse first pricks your finger to
            test your hemoglobin level; a low hemoglobin count indicates anemia and
            may mean that you shouldn't give blood that day. Mild anemia is generally of
            little importance, but some types can be very serious.</p>

            larynx may become so sore that it's difficult to talk. Some of us enjoy making
            up our own -itis words; high-school teachers, for example, long ago noticed
            that many of their seniors tended to lose all interest in schoolwork and start
            skipping classes, and labeled the condition senioritis.</p>

        <p>bursitis Inflammation of a lubricating sac (bursa), especially of

        <p>&bull; My barber developed bursitis after many years of lifting his arms all day.
        </p>
        <p>A bursa is a little pouch filled with fluid that sits between a tendon and a
            bone. When the fluid becomes infected by bacteria or irritated by too much
            movement, bursitis results. Throwing a baseball too many times at one
            session, for example, may inflame and irritate one of the bursae (notice the
            plural form) in the shoulder. Bursitis in another part of the body may be
            known by a traditional name such as &ldquo;housemaid's knee,&rdquo; &ldquo;soldier's heel,&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;tennis elbow.&rdquo; Bursitis generally goes away after a few weeks of resting the
            affected area, and the pain can be treated with ice packs and aspirin.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The liver, the body's largest gland, performs many important tasks, but is also
            vulnerable to many illnesses. At least five types of hepatitis, labeled with the
            letters A&ndash;E, are caused by viruses. The most common are hepatitis A,
            acquired through contaminated food and water; hepatitis B, which usually
            travels via sexual activity or shared needles; and hepatitis C, generally passed
            through shared needles. Some other types, including alcoholic hepatitis
            (caused by drinking too much alcohol), aren't infectious. There are vaccines
            for types A and B, and drug treatments for A, B, and C, though the drugs

        </p>
        <p>The bronchial tubes carry air into the tiny branches and smaller cells of the
            lungs. In bronchitis, the tubes become sore and you develop a deep cough.
            Bronchitis caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but there's no
            drug treatment for the more common kind caused by a virus. A bout of
            bronchitis may involve a couple of weeks of coughing (with no laughing
            allowed), weakness, and loss of energy and interest in doing things. Apart

            scientific knowledge and technology, has there been a need for a prefix
            meaning &ldquo;extremely small&rdquo;&mdash;a need that's been filled by nano-, which today
            is being attached to all kinds of words, sometimes not very seriously
            (nanoskirt, nano-brained, etc.).</p>

        <p>nanotechnology The science of manipulating

            devices such as robots.

        <p>&bull; Nanotechnology is now seen as contributing to numerous environmental
            solutions, from cleaning up hazardous waste sites to producing strong but
            lightweight materials for auto bodies.
        </p>
        <p>Nanotechnology, or nanotech for short, deals with matter at a level that most
            of us find hard to imagine, since it involves objects with dimensions of 100
            billionths of a meter (1/800th of the thickness of a human hair) or less. The
            chemical and physical properties of materials often change greatly at this
            scale. Nanotechnology is already being used in automobile tires, land-mine
            detectors, and computer disk drives. Nanomedicine is a particularly exciting
            field: Imagine particles the size of a blood cell that could be released into the
            bloodstream to form into tiny robots and attack cancer cells, or &ldquo;machines&rdquo;
            the size of a molecule that could actually repair the damaged interiors of
            individual cells.</p>

        <p>The nonserious use of nanosecond is probably much more common than the
            proper technical use. In measurement terms such as nanosecond, nanogram,
            and nanometer, nano- means &ldquo;billionth&rdquo;; in other kinds of words, its meaning
            isn't quite so precise. In computers, the speed of reading and writing to
            random access memory (RAM) is measured in nanoseconds. By comparison,
            the speed of reading or writing to a hard drive or a CD-ROM player, or for
            information to travel over the Internet, is measured in milliseconds
            (thousandths of a second), which are a million times longer than

        </p>
        <p>&bull; In the 1990s the physics department, which had been doing extensive
            research on microstructures, began to get deeply involved in nanostructures,
            including nanofoam, nanoflakes, and nanofibers.
        </p>
        <p>Two important types of nanostructure are nanocrystals (tiny crystals, often of
            semiconducting material) and nanotubes (tiny tubes, usually of pure carbon).
            Nanocrystals made from semiconductors change color depending on their
            size, and are being used for such tasks as detecting viruses in living cells.
            Nanotubes can conduct enormous amounts of electrical current, far more than
            metal wires. They are the basic material of tiny &ldquo;paper&rdquo; batteries, which can
            be rolled, folded, or cut while still producing power. Nanotubes are also now
            being used in materials for lightweight tennis rackets and golf clubs, and may

        <p>SUPER a Latin prefix meaning &ldquo;over, higher, more than,&rdquo; has become one
            of the most familiar prefixes in English, one of those prefixes that we use to
            create new words all the time: supermodel, superpowerful, superjock,
            supersize, supersweet&mdash;the list goes on and on. This all seems to have started
            in 1903 when the playwright G. B. Shaw translated the German word
            &Uuml;bermensch, Nietzsche's famous term for the person who rises to heroic
            heights through discipline and creative power, in the title of his play Man and
            Superman. The comic-book character with the same name wouldn't make his

        <p>&bull; My Freshman Comp professor removes all superfluous words from our
            essays, and usually ends up shortening mine by about 40 percent.
        </p>
        <p>Since the Latin fluere means &ldquo;to flow&rdquo; (see FLU), you can think of
            superfluous as describing a river with so much water that it's overflowing its
            banks. The word is used in all kinds of contexts. Superfluous characters in
            computer code may keep it from working. Most of the buttons on a remote
            control may strike us as superfluous, since we never use them. When a
            situation &ldquo;speaks for itself,&rdquo; any comment may be superfluous. And
            whenever you yourself are feeling superfluous, as in a &ldquo;Two's company,
            three's a crowd&rdquo; situation, it's probably time to leave.</p>

        <p>&bull; In learning to speak again after suffering a massive stroke, he had overcome
            what seemed like insuperable odds.

        <p>From its roots, the literal meaning of insuperable would be something like
            &ldquo;un-get-overable&rdquo;; insurmountable is a fairly exact synonym. Insuperable is
            used to describe obstacles, difficulties, barriers, obstructions, problems, and
            objections. Americans love stories of people who succeed in spite of terrible
            handicaps, whether as a result of physical limitations, prejudice, poverty, or

            had all the rights of a citizen.
        </p>
        <p>The Latin word supersedere means &ldquo;sit on top of&rdquo;&mdash;which is one way of
            taking someone else's place. Your boss may send around a memo that
            supersedes the memo she sent the day before (the one with all the errors in
            it). Every time the first-class postage rate goes up, the new stamps supersede
            the old ones. In science, a new theory often supersedes an older one; for
            example, the theory that a characteristic you acquire during your lifetime can
            be passed on biologically to your children (called Lamarckism) was
            superseded by Darwin's theory of evolution. Watch out when spelling this

            outstanding, but if your next paper comes back from your teacher with the
            comment &ldquo;Superlative work!&rdquo; at the top you probably won't complain. Since
            superlative means &ldquo;best, greatest,&rdquo; it makes sense that superlative is also a
            term used in grammar for the highest degree of comparison. So for the
            adjective simple, for example, the comparative form is simpler and the
            superlative form is simplest; and for the adverb boldly, the comparative form
            is more boldly and the superlative is most boldly.</p>

            debase their countries' currency by reducing the percentage of valuable metal

        <p>Harming someone's reputation in speech with falsehoods is known as slander,

            includes speech as well). Any ordinary citizen who can claim to have
            suffered harm as a result of such defamation may sue. So why aren't
            politicians suing all the time? Because an exception is made for &ldquo;public

        <p>&bull; If we can prove that you signed the contract because you were being
            physically threatened, it will automatically be declared null.
        </p>
        <p>Null is used mostly by lawyers, mathematicians, and computer programmers.
            In law, it usually occurs in the phrase &ldquo;null and void&rdquo; (which means about the
            same thing as null itself). When one of the parties that has signed a contract
            doesn't hold up his or her part of the deal&mdash;for example, if a contract states
            that a supplier must supply a million screws of a certain quality of steel, and
            it turns out the screws supplied were of inferior steel&mdash;the other company can
            refuse to pay anything, claiming the contract is null and void. In mathematics,
            null means &ldquo;lacking any elements&rdquo;; a null set is a set of figures that's actually
            empty. In computer programming, a null is a character that doesn't actually
            show up as a character, but instead may just be required to show that a series

        <p>annulment An official statement that something is no longer
            valid.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; He requested an annulment of the marriage from the Church, but his wife
            claimed that, after 15 years and two children, the idea of annulment was
            ridiculous.
        </p>
        <p>Annulment usually applies to marriage. In some states an annulment may be
            carried out by a court (&ldquo;judicial annulment&rdquo;), but annulment is generally
            practiced by a church (&ldquo;ecclesiastic annulment&rdquo;), and principally the Roman
            Catholic Church, which traditionally hasn't permitted divorce. The usual
            acceptable reason for annulment is a &ldquo;failure to consummate&rdquo; the marriage by
            having children. Unlike a marriage that ends in divorce, an annulled marriage
            is considered never to have existed. Other things can be annulled as well,
            including a contract (if one party fails to comply with its terms) or an election
            (if it wasn't carried out properly).</p>

            driven by electric power.
        </p>
        <p>A Spanish word that originally meant simply &ldquo;armed,&rdquo; armada is now used
            in Spanish-speaking nations as the name of their national navies. In English,
            the word usually has historical overtones. The Great Armada of 1588 was a
            120-ship fleet sent by Philip II of Spain in an attempt to invade Elizabethan
            England; it was defeated when British forces lit eight ships afire and sent
            them sailing into the Armada's midst, then blocked the passage to the south
            so that the remaining ships were forced to sail northward around Britain in
            order to return home, causing dozens more ships to be wrecked in the stormy
            northern seas. Today we sometimes use the word humorously for fleets of
            fishing boats, rowboats, or canoes.</p>

        <p>armistice An agreement to stop fighting a war; a truce.

            armistice between the warring forces.
        </p>
        <p>Just as the solstice is the time of year when the sun (Latin, sol) &ldquo;stands still,&rdquo;
            an armistice is an agreement for armies to stop where they are and lay down
            their arms. The word is associated with the truce that marked the end of
            World War I on the Western Front, where the Allies had confronted
            Germany, in 1918. The day of the ceasefire, November 11th (&ldquo;the eleventh
            day of the eleventh month&rdquo;), was for many years called Armistice Day; today
            it's known as Veterans Day in the U.S. and as Remembrance Day in Canada

        </p>
        <p>An armory has traditionally been a military storage compound where
            machine guns, rifles, pistols, ammunition, parts, and accessories are kept. In
            the U.S., National Guard and Reserve units often use armories as training
            headquarters in peacetime. Ever since George Washington established the
            country's first armory in Springfield in 1777, arsenals and armories of the
            Army Ordnance Corps have had a remarkable history of arms manufacture.</p>

        <p>insurgency A usually violent attempt to take control of a

        </p>
        <p>&bull; The Mexican press was fascinated by the armed insurgency's mysterious
            leader, who wore a mask and went by the name of Subcomandante Marcos.
        </p>
        <p>Insurgencies fall into the category of &ldquo;irregular warfare,&rdquo; since an insurgency
            normally lacks the organization of a revolution, even though it has the same
            aims. Revolutions often begin within a country's armed forces, whereas
            insurgencies often arise in remote areas, where they gain strength slowly by
            winning the confidence of rural populations. An insurgency may be based on
            ethnic or religious identity, or its roots may be basically political or
            economic. Since insurgencies are rarely strong enough to face a national
            army head-on, insurgents (often called guerrillas) tend to use such tactics as
            bombing, kidnapping, hostage taking, and hijacking.</p>

        <p>A counterinsurgent is, as you might guess, someone who combats an
            insurgency. Counterinsurgency efforts often attempt to win the &ldquo;hearts and
            minds&rdquo; of a population by hiring and paying local villagers, opening health
            clinics and schools, organizing sports programs, and providing agricultural
            assistance. These terms were first used to describe the American effort to
            strengthen the South Vietnamese government against communist forces in the
            1960s&mdash;an effort that eventually ended in defeat.</p>

        <p>resurgent Rising again into life, activity, or prominence.

        <p>&bull; The country had let down its guard over the summer, and in the fall a
            resurgent flu virus overwhelmed the public-health system, killing tens of
            thousands.
        </p>
        <p>Resurgent means literally a &ldquo;rising again&rdquo; (see RE). We may speak of a
            resurgent baseball team, a resurgent steel industry, the resurgence of jogging,
            or a resurgence of violence in a war zone. Resurgence is particularly
            prominent in its Italian translation, risorgimento. In the 19th century, when
            the Italian peninsula consisted of a number of small independent states, a
            popular movement known as the Risorgimento managed to unify the
            peninsula and create the modern state of Italy in 1870.</p>

        <p>In geology, a stratum is a layer of rock or soil that is distinct from those
            above and below it. Rock and soil strata (notice the plural form) can be seen
            in road cuts, cliffs, quarries, riverbanks, and sand dunes, and in pieces of
            limestone, slate, and shale. Archaeologists digging in historical sites are
            careful to note the stratum where each artifact is found. Earth scientists divide
            the earth's atmosphere into strata, just as oceanographers divide the ocean's
            depths into strata. And for social scientists, a stratum is a group of people
            who are similar in some way, such as education, culture, or income.</p>

        <p>stratification The process or state of being formed,

        </p>
        <p>&bull; The stratification of the lake in summer keeps oxygen-rich cold water at the
            bottom, where coldwater fish such as trout take refuge.
        </p>
        <p>If you look for it, you'll find stratification almost everywhere. On a tall rain-
            forest tree, there may be different air plants clinging to it, different insects
            crawling on it, and different mammals making their homes at different levels.
            The earth beneath you may be stratified into several distinctive layers within
            the first 20 feet. If the wind you're feeling is moving at 10 miles per hour, at
            30 feet above your head it may be 20 mph, and in the jet stream above that it
            may be 150 mph. If you climb a high mountain in Himalayas, you may begin

            layer under the topsoil, lacking in organic matter or humus. Substrate is part
            of the vocabulary of various other sciences, including chemistry and biology.
            But although it's mostly a scientific term, writers may also use it to mean
            simply &ldquo;foundation&rdquo;&mdash;for instance, when observing that reading is the

        <p>&bull; A dark bank of stratocumulus clouds was moving in quickly, and in March

        <p>When a cloud type forms a broad &ldquo;layer&rdquo; over the earth, the strat- root shows

            high, thin layer often covering the entire sky (but without the wispy curls of
            ice crystals that give pure cirrus clouds their name). Altostratus (&ldquo;high
            layer&rdquo;) clouds form a darkish gray mid-altitude layer. Nimbostratus
            (&ldquo;rainstorm layer&rdquo;) clouds form a low, dark layer of gray cloud that usually
            produces light but continuous rain, snow, or sleet (but not violent storms of
            the kind that give pure nimbus clouds their name). Cumulus (&ldquo;heap&rdquo;) is the

            keeps you at about the same job level and salary. A coach might have special
            drills to improve his players' lateral speed and agility. The British speak of
            &ldquo;lateral thinking,&rdquo; thinking that grabs ideas that may not seem to be relevant
            but turn out to work well&mdash;what we might call &ldquo;thinking outside the box.&rdquo;
            But we know lateral best from football. A lateral pass is a pass of the ball
            between teammates that usually goes to the side and slightly backward from
            the direction in which they're advancing; unlike a forward pass, a lateral may
            be made from any position, and any number may be made in a single play.</p>

        <p>bilateral Involving two groups or countries.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Instead of working on a set of separate bilateral trade agreements, they
            propose bringing the countries of the region together to sign a single joint
            agreement.
        </p>
        <p>Since the prefix bi- means &ldquo;two&rdquo; in Latin (see BI/BIN), bilateral means
            essentially &ldquo;two-sided.&rdquo; In the days when there were two superpowers, the
            U.S. and the Soviet Union regularly engaged in bilateral arms negotiations;
            such negotiations are much less common today. Sometimes bilateral refers to
            two sides of the same thing. A bilateral hip replacement, for instance,
            replaces both hip bones in the same operation. And bilateral symmetry (a
            term often used by biologists) refers to the fact that, in many organisms (such
            as humans), the left side is basically the mirror image of the right side.</p>

        <p>collateral (1) Associated but of secondary importance. (2)
            Related but not in a direct or close way.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Though the army referred to the civilian deaths as &ldquo;collateral damage,&rdquo;
            since civilians weren't the intended targets, the incident aroused intense anger
            among the survivors.
        </p>
        <p>If an official talking about some policy refers to a collateral issue, he or she
            means something that may be affected but isn't central to the discussion. To
            an anthropologist, your cousin would be called a collateral relative, since he
            or she (unlike your grandmother, brother, or daughter) is &ldquo;off to the side&rdquo; of
            your direct line of descent. As a noun, collateral means something provided
            to a lender as a guarantee of repayment. So if you take out a loan or mortgage
            to buy a car or house, the loan agreement usually states that the car or house
            is collateral that goes to the lender if the sum isn't paid.</p>

        <p>equilateral Having all sides or faces equal.

        <p>&bull; On her desk she kept an equilateral prism, through which every morning the
            sun would project the colors of the spectrum onto the far wall.
        </p>
        <p>Since equi- means &ldquo;equal&rdquo; (see EQU), the meaning of equilateral is easy to
            guess from its roots. The word is mostly used in geometry. The standard
            polygons (many-sided geometrical shapes)&mdash;the pentagon, hexagon, octagon,
            etc.&mdash;are assumed to be equilateral if we don't say otherwise; an equilateral
            rectangle has the special name square. But triangles are particularly
            important, and many triangles are not equal-sided. The standard polyhedrons
            (many-sided solids) are also equilateral. Most common is the cube, all of
            whose sides are square. The tetrahedron has four triangular sides and thus is a
            pyramid with a triangular base, unlike the pyramids of Egypt with their
            square bases.</p>

        <p>TOM comes from the Greek root meaning &ldquo;cut.&rdquo; Thus, the Latin word

        <p>appendectomy Surgical removal of the human
            appendix.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Appendectomy is an emergency procedure, since appendicitis can be fatal if
            its symptoms are ignored.
        </p>
        <p>The appendix is a tiny tube attached to the large intestine that no longer has
            any real function. Appendicitis&mdash;inflammation and swelling of the appendix,
            usually as a result of bacterial infection&mdash;generally occurs between the ages
            of 10 and 19, and is the most common reason for emergency surgery in the
            U.S. today. Since the appendix has so little to do, appendectomies normally
            have no negative aftereffects at all. If appendicitis is ignored, bacteria may
            enter the blood and infect other parts of the body.</p>

        <p>gastrectomy Surgical removal of all or part of the

            rejected.
        </p>

        <p>The tonsils are the areas of tissue that you can see in the mirror on both sides
            of your throat (not to be confused with the uvula, which hangs down in the
            middle). Tonsillectomy, the most common surgery performed on children in
            the U.S., is intended to relieve tonsillitis, or inflammation of the tonsils
            (usually by strep or staph bacteria). But the fact is, tonsillitis can often be
            successfully treated with antibiotics, which means that surgery, including the
            week or two of pain and discomfort that follows it, is generally unnecessary.</p>

            cases can often be treated with drugs or with a small operation called a
            lumpectomy (because it removes a lump). Though a &ldquo;simple mastectomy&rdquo; is
            larger than a lumpectomy, it allows the breast to be reconstructed, using
            artificial implants or tissue from elsewhere on the body. But &ldquo;radical
            mastectomy,&rdquo; which is required when the cancer is at an advanced stage,

            bad handwriting, a patient may be given the wrong powerful drug. The sheer
            number of drugs on the market has led to dangerous drug interactions, which
            often occur when one doctor doesn't know what another is doing. Too many
            patients go to the hospital for some common treatment and pick up an
            antibiotic-resistant staph infection. And let's not even think about those

        <p>bariatric Relating to or specializing in the treatment of

        <p>&bull; In the type of bariatric surgery called gastric bypass, part of the stomach is
            actually stapled off.
        </p>
        <p>Baros means &ldquo;weight&rdquo; in Greek; so, for example, a barometer is an

            medical treatment of serious overweight&mdash;that is, obesity. Bariatric surgery is
            only employed when other methods of weight loss have been tried and failed.
            Though stapling the stomach may seem extreme, we now know that obesity
            greatly increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and stroke, so
            stomach surgery doesn't just help people look and feel better&mdash;it's a potential

        <p>Since most medical care is devoted to those over 65, geriatrics, the medical
            treatment of the elderly, is a highly important specialty. The specific
            problems of the elderly include physical inactivity and instability, which
            result from weakness and loss of energy. Weakness of the eyes and ears plays
            a role, and weakening of the immune system often leads to more disease. All
            these conditions can be made worse by mental problems, such as declining
            intellectual activity, declining memory, and depression, which may prevent
            the patient from taking action to improve his or her condition. But the effects
            of aging can be greatly relieved by proper care. And the greatest
            improvement often results when the patient is persuaded to become more
            physically, mentally, and socially active.</p>

        <p>podiatrist A doctor who treats injuries and diseases of the

            complaints like bunions, ankle sprains, arch pain, and hammertoes.

        <p>Most foot problems result from the fact that human feet were never designed

            have an entire medical specialty devoted to feet. In the U.S., a podiatrist is a
            doctor of podiatric medicine (D.P.M.), who is licensed to perform surgery.
            The root pod- comes from the Greek word for &ldquo;foot&rdquo; (compare PED). But in
            England a foot doctor is often called a chiropodist, a term that dates from the
            time when the same specialist treated hands as well, since chiro- means
            &ldquo;hand.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>MEDI comes from the Latin medius, meaning &ldquo;middle.&rdquo; Our word medium
            refers to something in a middle position. The medieval period of European
            history, also known as the Middle Ages, is the period between Greek and
            Roman antiquity and the &ldquo;modern age.&rdquo; But why people around 1620 began
            to use the term &ldquo;Middle Ages,&rdquo; because they regarded themselves as modern,
            is an interesting question.</p>
        <p />
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <p />
        <p>median In the middle; especially, having a value that is in the
            middle of a series of values arranged from smallest to largest.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The city's west side is well-off but its east side isn't, so the city's median
            house prices are typical for the region.
        </p>
        <p>People often use the word average without realizing that there are two
            common forms of average. Suppose you want to find the average net worth
            of a group of people&mdash;that is, the average value of everything they possess.
            To find one type of average, called the mean, you'd simply add up the total
            value of money and property of everyone in the group and divide it by the
            number of people. To find the other type, called the median, you'd identify
            the net worth of the person who is richer than half the people and poorer than
            the other half. So if Warren Buffett drove through a tiny village in India, the
            mean net worth of those in the village would suddenly rise to perhaps a
            billion dollars, but their median net worth would remain close to zero. Which
            figure would be more meaningful?</p>

        <p>mediate (1) To work with opposing sides in an argument or
            dispute in order to get an agreement. (2) To achieve a settlement or
            agreement by working with the opposing sides.

        <p>&bull; He was the third person who had attempted to mediate the dispute between
            the firm and its striking workers, the first two having given up in despair.
        </p>
        <p>Mediation is often used in disputes between companies and labor unions, and
            the government actually provides mediators for such disagreements. The
            mediator tries to bring the two sides to an agreement, but doesn't have the
            power to actually order such an agreement. Mediators also sometimes have a
            role in international disputes; when two neighboring countries claim
            exclusive fishing rights in the same ocean waters, for example, they may
            invite a trained mediator to help settle the argument. Arbitration is similar to
            mediation, but in arbitration both parties in a dispute agree to accept the
            arbitrator's decision.</p>

        <p>&bull; The divorce had been bitter, and the two now communicated only through
            an old friend who they both trusted as an intermediary.
        </p>
        <p>Since inter- means &ldquo;between, among&rdquo; (see INTER), an intermediary is
            someone who moves back and forth in the middle area between two sides&mdash;a
            &ldquo;go-between.&rdquo; Mediator (which shares the medi- root) is often a synonym,
            and so is facilitator; broker and agent are often others. Thus, a real-estate
            broker or agent shuttles between a house's buyer and seller, who may never
            even meet each other. Financial intermediation is what happens when you put
            money in a bank or investment firm, which then invests it in various
            companies; if you want, you can instead cut out the intermediary and invest
            the money directly in companies of your own choosing.</p>

        <p>&bull; He's the kind of person who can get depressed by the mediocrity of a
            dinner, or even a wine.
        </p>
        <p>People interested in words always point out that mediocrity doesn't mean
            quite what its main root would indicate: Why doesn't it describe something
            that's right in the middle of the pack, exactly what you would expect? Instead
            the words mediocrity and mediocre always suggest disappointment. A
            mediocre play is one you wish you hadn't wasted an evening on, and the
            mediocre actor in it should probably find another profession. A person can
            even be called a mediocrity, though it isn't very nice and you'd never do it to
            his face.</p>

            look like a lopsided diamond or rectangle. As both a noun and an adjective,
            rhomboid can be applied to anything with those shapes, such as certain
            muscles of the upper back when viewed from behind. Whenever you hear
            about rhomboid exercises, rhomboid strain, or rhomboid pain, it involves
            those muscles, which attach your shoulder blades to your spine and can be
            strained by carrying a heavy backpack, serving a tennis ball, or just slumping

        <p>The fourth letter of the Greek alphabet is delta, and a capital delta is triangle-

            &ldquo;having a triangular shape,&rdquo; and botanists often use the word to describe the
            shape of certain leaves. The triangular, swept-back wings seen on jet fighter
            aircraft are called delta wings. Your deltoid muscles&mdash;not far from your
            rhomboids&mdash;form a cap on your shoulders, and some gym trainers even treat

        <p>SCOP which usually appears in a suffix, comes from the Greek skopein,
            meaning &ldquo;to look at.&rdquo; In English we have the simple noun scope, along with
            some other words it sometimes stands for: telescope, microscope, periscope,
            and so on. And have you ever used a stereoscope, a device your great-
            grandparents probably enjoyed, which lets you look through a viewer at two
            slightly different photographs of the same thing, one with each eye, to enjoy
            the illusion that you're seeing it in three dimensions?</p>

        <p>endoscope A lighted tubular medical instrument for viewing
            the interior or a hollow organ or body part that typically has one or more
            channels to permit passage of surgical instruments.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Possible uses of the endoscope outside of medicine soon became apparent,
            and soon mechanics were using specially designed endoscopes to view the
            insides of jet engines.
        </p>
        <p>The Greek prefix endo- means &ldquo;within, inside,&rdquo; so around 1860 an early
            crude instrument for looking deep inside the body was named the endoscope.
            But modern endoscopy required the invention of the electric lightbulb and
            then fiber-optic cable, so the first modern endoscopes date only to 1967. An
            endoscope may be inserted through a natural passageway (for example,
            through the nose or down the esophagus) or through a tiny cut in the skin. A
            tiny camera with a light at the end of the cable sends back images onto a
            screen, and the surgeon uses special instruments that work through a tube
            alongside the cable. There are now specialized types of endoscopes for every
            part of the body, where they can take tissue samples, cut out small growths,
            or remove foreign objects.</p>

        <p>arthroscopic Relating to a fiber-optic instrument that is

        <p>&bull; The day he scheduled the fourth arthroscopic operation on his knee was the
            day he decided to hang up his football cleats.
        </p>
        <p>In Greek, arthron means &ldquo;joint.&rdquo; Arthritis is a condition of swollen and
            painful joints, and arthropods are animals (including insects, arachnids, and
            crustaceans) that have a segmented body and jointed limbs. Arthroscopic
            surgery, or arthroscopy, has revolutionized the treatment of joint injuries. It's
            performed with an arthroscope, a specialized type of endoscope (see above).
            A tiny camera and a light are inserted through a small cut in the skin, and
            through another cut nearby a tiny surgical instrument, controlled through its
            own cable, is inserted. The surgeon then performs the operation, guided by
            the images sent back via the fiber-optic cable. Most patients walk out of the
            hospital on crutches the same day, though full recovery may take a couple of
            months.</p>

        <p>laparoscopy Examination of the interior of the

            abdomen's wall.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The initial laparoscopy involves inserting the cable through a tiny cut and
            inflating the internal area with carbon dioxide so that a good-sized area will
            become visible.
        </p>
        <p>Since laparo- means &ldquo;wall of the abdomen,&rdquo; a laparoscope is an endoscope
            designed especially to examine the abdomen. Common laparoscopic
            surgeries include removal of the gallbladder, appendix, or kidney, and
            removal of tumors from abdominal organs. Like the other endoscopic
            surgeries, laparoscopy, as compared to traditional surgery, reduces risk of
            bleeding, pain following the operation, patient recovery time, and length of
            hospital stays.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In Latin oscillare means &ldquo;to swing,&rdquo; and our word oscillation usually means
            &ldquo;vibration&rdquo; or &ldquo;variation,&rdquo; especially in a changing flow of electricity. The
            oscilloscope basically draws a graph of an electrical signal. Since all kinds of
            physical phenomena can be converted into an electric voltage, oscilloscopes
            can be used to measure such things as sound, light, and heat. So an
            oscilloscope can analyze how one clarinet's sound is different from another's,
            or how one bulb's light differs from another's. Auto mechanics use
            oscilloscopes to measure engine vibrations; doctors use them to measure
            brain waves. Audio technicians use oscilloscopes to diagnose problems in
            audio equipment; TV and radio technicians use them to diagnose TV and
            radio problems. But oscilloscopes are most essential today to high-tech

            the sun, his garments became brilliantly white, and a voice from heaven
            proclaimed that this was the son of God. Transfiguration was first used in
            English as the name of this biblical event, and the Feast of the
            Transfiguration remains the name of a holy day. So the word has always kept
            a somewhat religious&mdash;and almost always positive&mdash;tone. A face may be
            transfigured by joy, and an &ldquo;ugly duckling&rdquo; may be slowly transfigured into a
            radiant beauty. And as Harry Potter fans know, transfiguration is a subject
            long taught at the Hogwarts School by Minerva McGonagall.</p>

        <p>transponder A radio or radar set that emits a radio signal
            after receiving such a signal.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; When a patient is admitted to an emergency room, an implanted transponder
            can relay important data about his or her medical history.
        </p>
        <p>This word was coined during World War II by simply joining pieces of the
            words transmitter and responder. Transponders are basic to modern aviation
            and communications satellites, and they're finding new uses in fields such as
            medicine as well. But they're now also part of everyday life. The &ldquo;E-ZPass&rdquo;
            that lets you drive right through turnpike tollbooths is a transponder, and the
            car you're driving may not even start unless it recognizes the signal from your
            personal key's transponder. In a big crowded foot race, you may carry a tiny
            transponder on your shoe that records when you cross both the starting line
            and the finish line.</p>

        <p>transcendent (1) Exceeding or rising above usual limits;

            existence.

        <p>&bull; Despite the chaos around her she remained calm, with a transcendent smile
            on her face.
        </p>
        <p>The Latin verb scandere means &ldquo;to climb,&rdquo; so transcend has the basic
            meaning of climbing so high that you cross some boundary. A transcendent
            experience is one that takes you out of yourself and convinces you of a larger
            life or existence; in this sense, it means something close to &ldquo;spiritual.&rdquo; The
            American writers and thinkers known as the Transcendentalists, including
            Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, believed in the unity of all
            creation, the basic goodness of humankind, and the superiority of spiritual
            vision over mere logic. When we speak of the transcendent importance of an
            issue such as climate change, we may mean that everything else on earth
            actually depends on it.</p>

        <p>PRO is an important prefix, with a couple of quite different broad meanings.
            In this section, we'll look at words in which pro- has the basic meaning &ldquo;for&rdquo;
            or &ldquo;favoring.&rdquo; Everyone knows words like pro-democracy and pro-American,

        <p>proactive Acting in anticipation of future problems, needs, or

        </p>
        <p>&bull; Our president prides himself on being proactive, and is always imagining
            situations the company might be facing in three or four years.
        </p>
        <p>People who tend to react to a problem only when it's gotten serious could be
            called reactive people. Until recently, reactive (in this sense) didn't really
            have an antonym. So proactive was coined to describe the kind of person
            who's always looking into the future in order to be prepared for anything. A
            good parent attempts to be proactive on behalf of his or her children, trying to
            imagine the problems they might be facing in a few months or years. A
            company's financial officers study the patterns of the company's earnings to
            make sure it won't risk running short of cash at any point in the next year or
            two. Proactive has only been around a few decades, and it can still sometimes
            sound like a fashionable buzzword.</p>

        <p>pro bono Being, involved in, or doing professional work, and
            especially legal work, donated for the public good.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The law firm allows her to do several hours of pro bono work every week,
            and she devotes it to helping poor immigrant families.
        </p>
        <p>In Latin, pro bono publico means &ldquo;for the public good&rdquo;; in English we
            generally shorten the phrase to pro bono. Donating free legal help to those
            who need it has long been a practice of American law firms; the American
            Bar Association actually recommends that all lawyers donate 50 hours a year.
            Pro bono work is sometimes donated by nonlegal firms as well. For example,
            an advertising firm might produce a 60-second video for an environmental or
            educational organization, or a strategic-planning firm might prepare a start-up
            plan for a charity that funds shelters for battered women.</p>

        <p>proponent One who argues in favor of something: advocate.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The new governor is a proponent of a longer school year, and he's gotten a
            lot of support from parents.
        </p>
        <p>Proponent comes from the same Latin word as propose, so a proponent is
            someone who proposes something, or at least supports it by speaking and
            writing in favor of it. Thus, for example, proponents of casinos argue that
            they create jobs, whereas proponents of a casino ban&mdash;that is, casino
            opponents&mdash;argue that they're corrupting and they take money away from
            people who can't afford it. As a rule, just about anything important that gets
            proposed also gets opposed.</p>

        <p>pro forma Done or existing as something that is required but

        </p>
        <p>&bull; The letter she received from him after her husband's death struck her as pro
            forma, and she knew the old friendship between the two men had never really
            been repaired.
        </p>
        <p>A lot of things are done for the sake of appearances. A teacher might get
            officially observed and evaluated every three years, even though everyone
            knows she's terrific and the whole thing is strictly pro forma. A critic might
            say that a orchestral conductor gave a pro forma performance, since his heart
            wasn't in it. A business owner might make a pro forma appearance at the
            funeral of a politician's mother, never having met her but maybe hoping for a
            favor from her son sometime in the future. In business, pro forma has some
            special meanings; a pro forma invoice, for example, will list all the items
            being sent but, unlike a true invoice, won't be an actual bill.</p>

        <p>PRO in its other broad meaning, means &ldquo;before, in front of.&rdquo; So, for

        <p>Since trudere means &ldquo;to thrust&rdquo; in Latin, protrude means basically &ldquo;to thrust
            forward.&rdquo; If your neighbors' patio protrudes over your property boundary,
            you may want to discuss it with them. A protruding disc in your spine may
            have to be operated on sooner or later; superficial protrusions, such as corns

        <p>prophylaxis Measures designed to preserve health and

            better than treating them after being bitten.
        </p>
        <p>In Greek, phylax means &ldquo;guard,&rdquo; so prophylactic measures guard against
            disease by taking action ahead of time. Thus, for example, before the polio
            vaccine became available, prophylaxis against polio included avoiding
            crowds and public swimming pools. These days a well-known kind of
            prophylactic is used to prevent sexually transmitted diseases; but
            prophylactic measures only work when people use them.</p>

        <p>&bull; The country's new constitution was officially promulgated in a grand
            ceremony at the presidential palace.
        </p>
        <p>All laws need to be made public in some way so that citizens may know if
            they're in danger of breaking them. Since they can't be expected to go into
            effect until the population knows they exist, promulgate has the two
            meanings &ldquo;proclaim&rdquo; and &ldquo;put into effect.&rdquo; In ancient Greece and Rome,
            when most people couldn't read, a new written law would actually be
            proclaimed in a public place; we've all seen such scenes in historical movies.
            But today promulgation of a law generally occurs simply by its being
            published in an official government publication and on a government Web
            site. New laws are also often reported in newspapers and on TV, though
            rarely in complete form.</p>

        <p>prologue (1) An introduction to a literary work. (2) An

        </p>
        <p>&bull; The Boston Tea Party of 1773 turned out to be a prologue to the American
            Revolution.
        </p>
        <p>In ancient Greek drama, the prologos (a word that means basically &ldquo;speaking
            before&rdquo;) was the opening portion of the play, before the entry of the all-
            important chorus. It might be spoken by a single actor, maybe playing a god,
            who would &ldquo;set the scene&rdquo; for the audience. Playwrights today instead often
            provide the same kind of &ldquo;scene-setting&rdquo; information through dialogue near
            the play's beginning; in movies, it may appear (as in the &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; series)
            in the form of actual written text. In a nonfiction book, the lead-in is now
            usually called a preface or introduction; novels rarely provide any
            introduction at all. Still, prologue remains a useful word for nonliterary
            purposes. The saying &ldquo;The past is prologue&rdquo; tells us that, in real life, almost
            everything can be a prologue to what follows it.</p>

            something closer to its final form, but also often meaning a new version of

            essentially &ldquo;to calm again.&rdquo; Warring friends can often be reconciled by a nice
            note or apology. When you're faced with two things that don't square very
            well, you may have to reconcile them, the way a scientist might try to
            reconcile the differing results from two research projects. The U.S. House
            and Senate, in a process called reconciliation, try to produce one final bill
            from two different versions that they've passed separately. To reconcile
            yourself to something means to get used to it; thus, you may need to reconcile
            yourself to not getting to the beach next summer, or you may have reconciled
            yourself to the idea of your daughter in the Peace Corps marrying a
            Mongolian goat herder.</p>

        <p>RE- in its other main sense, means &ldquo;back&rdquo; or backward.&rdquo; Since doing
            something again means going back to it, the two senses are actually related;
            still, the meaning of re- in most words is pretty clearly one or the other. So a
            rebound comes back at you; to recall means to &ldquo;call back&rdquo; a memory; and to
            react is to &ldquo;act back&rdquo; at someone else's action.</p>

        <p>In Latin, reciprocus means &ldquo;returning the same way&rdquo; or &ldquo;alternating.&rdquo; So in a
            reciprocating engine, like the one in your car, the pistons move back and
            forth, and that motion is transformed into the rotary motion of the crankshaft.
            A reciprocal is a pair of numbers (such as 5/6 and 6/5) that can be multiplied
            to produce 1. Reciprocity (with the accent on the third syllable) between two
            nations means they agree to recognize certain things granted in one country
            as being valid in the other&mdash;for example, your driver's license.</p>

            by the mayor's office, but the damage had been done.
        </p>
        <p>The -but in rebut once meant basically &ldquo;butt,&rdquo; so rebut's original meanings
            were &ldquo;to drive or beat back&rdquo; and &ldquo;to attack with violent language.&rdquo; Rebuttals
            can still be rather violent, as anyone who has watched some heated moments
            in a presidential debate can testify. The word is often used by lawyers, since
            the lawyer for the accused or for the party being sued almost always tries to

        <p>Since vocare means &ldquo;to call&rdquo; in Latin (see VOC), to revoke is to &ldquo;call back.&rdquo;
            Your driver's license could be revoked after about three convictions for
            driving under the influence of alcohol; some people's licenses are even
            revoked for life. You could get your passport revoked if a judge thought you
            had violated the terms of your bail and suspected you might skip the country.

            and its corruption and dire poverty had gotten much harder to ignore.
        </p>
        <p>As you might guess, regress is the opposite of progress. So if a disease
            regresses, that's generally a good thing, but in most other ways we prefer not
            to regress. If someone's mental state has been improving, we hope he or she
            won't start to regress; and when a nation's promising educational system
            begins to regress, that's a bad sign for the country's future. Economists often
            distinguish between a progressive tax and a regressive tax; in a progressive
            tax, the percentage that goes to taxes gets larger as the amount of money
            being taxed gets larger, while in a regressive tax the percentage gets smaller.

        <p>DERM comes from the Greek derma, meaning &ldquo;skin.&rdquo; For medical advice on
            a skin problem such as acne, we may go to a dermatologist, or skin specialist.
            When we get a shot, it's usually with a hypodermic, a needle that goes &ldquo;under
            the skin&rdquo; (see HYP/HYPO). A pachyderm is a &ldquo;thick-skinned&rdquo; animal, which
            most of us just call an elephant.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The word dermal often comes up nowadays in connection with cosmetic
            treatments. Dermal therapy usually means restoring moisture to dry, cracked
            skin. Dermal fillers such as collagen can be injected to fill in acne scars or
            reduce wrinkles. These have now been joined by treatments like Botox,
            which paralyzes facial dermal muscles, again in order to reduce wrinkles
            (since those dermal muscles are used to form expressions). A synonym for
            dermal is cutaneous.</p>

            injury, and environmental stresses.
        </p>
        <p>Epidermis includes the Greek prefix epi-, meaning &ldquo;outer&rdquo; (see EPI); thus,
            the epidermis overlies the dermis, or inner layer of skin. The epidermis itself
            consists of four or five layers; the outermost layer is made of dead cells,
            which are being shed continuously. The epidermis acts as a physical barrier
            &mdash;a protective wrap over the body's surface, which, by preventing water loss,
            allows vertebrates to live on land.</p>

            (with its fur, hair, or feathers), then create a plaster cast of the carcass with
            which to produce a &ldquo;mannequin,&rdquo; on which they replace the skin. Producing

            of some kind. Contact dermatitis is caused by something (often a chemical)
            touching the skin. Atopic dermatitis usually affects the insides of the elbows,
            the backs of the knees, and the face; generally resulting from an inherited
            sensitivity, it's often triggered by inhaling something. Eczema, psoriasis, and

        <p>endocrine (1) A hormone. (2) Any of several glands (such as
            the thyroid) that pour their secretions directly into the blood or lymph.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Since the endocrines are so vital to human life, affecting such things as cell
            growth and blood sugar, the chemicals known as endocrine disrupters can be
            destructive and even deadly.
        </p>
        <p>The body's glands remove specific substances from the blood and alter them
            for rerelease into the blood or removal. Glands such as those that produce
            saliva and sweat secrete their products through tiny ducts or tubes on or near
            the body's surface. The glands without ducts, called the endocrine glands,
            instead secrete their products into the bloodstream; the endo- root indicates
            that the secretions are internal rather than on the surface. The endocrine
            system includes such glands as the pituitary (which controls growth, regulates
            the other endocrines, and performs many other tasks), the thyroid (another
            growth gland that also influences metabolism), the adrenals (which secrete
            adrenaline and steroids), the hypothalamus (which influences sleep and
            weight regulation), and the ovaries (which produce eggs). Endocrine
            problems are treated by endocrinologists.</p>

        <p>&bull; Her dentist told her the problem was endodontic and that she should see a
            specialist soon to prevent loss of the tooth.
        </p>
        <p>Endodontists, as you might expect from the endo- root, deal with the interior
            of the tooth. The tooth's enamel, on the outside, covers a thick layer called the
            dentin; this in turn surrounds the innermost part, called the pulp, a mass of
            soft tissue through which nerves and blood vessels run. When a tooth has
            been badly damaged by decay or cracking, producing a risk of dangerous
            infection of the pulp, a &ldquo;root canal&rdquo; procedure is performed by an
            endodontist. Try to avoid ever getting to know an endodontist; brush your
            teeth twice daily, floss before bedtime, and never let a cavity go unfilled for
            long.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When biologists need to make a distinction between things that are produced
            within a cell or organ and things that affect it from the outside, they use the
            terms endogenous and exogenous. It used to be thought, for instance, that
            mutations in cells always resulted from exogenous causes, until it was
            discovered that substances in the body, including those called oxidants, could
            cause them endogenously as well. &ldquo;Circadian rhythms&rdquo;&mdash;the regular cycles,
            roughly 24 hours in length, that plants, animals, and humans rely on to
            regulate their days&mdash;are endogenously generated and don't actually depend

        <p>endorphin Any of a group of proteins in the brain that are

        <p>&bull; On the final stretch of her daily five-mile run, she could usually count on
            the endorphins kicking in, giving her that beautiful &ldquo;runner's high.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>The word endorphin was coined, back when the substances were discovered
            in the 1970s, by joining pieces of endogenous and morphine, morphine being
            a narcotic that closely resembles the endorphins and relieves pain in a similar
            way. Studies suggest that the pain-relieving practice called acupuncture (see
            acupuncture) works by releasing endorphins. Endorphins also seem to play an
            important role in pregnancy. Though much remains to be learned about the
            endorphins, the general public seems ready to give them credit for any all-

        <p>NECRO comes from the Greek nekros, meaning &ldquo;dead body,&rdquo; so it's not
            surprising that it shows up in some unappetizing places. A necrophagous
            insect, for instance, is one that feeds on dead bodies; when homicide
            investigators discover a corpse, they may use the insect evidence to figure out
            when the person died.</p>

        <p>necrosis Death of living tissue, usually within a limited area.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; He had ignored the spider bite for several days, and his doctor was alarmed
            to see that serious necrosis had set in.
        </p>
        <p>Cells die naturally after a period of time, but may also die as a result of
            injuries, infections, or cancer. Burns produce necrosis, and the bedsores
            suffered by nursing-home patients are a form of necrosis. The dreaded
            condition known as gangrene, in which the dying tissue turns black or green,
            is another form. When untreated, the dying cells release substances that lead
            to the death of surrounding cells, so untreated necrosis can lead to death.
            Treatment usually requires the removal of the necrotic tissue, and in severe
            cases can even involve amputating a limb.</p>

        <p>necromancer One who conjures the spirits of the dead
            in order to magically reveal the future or influence the course of events.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Her specialty is communication with the dead, and she might once have
            been known as a necromancer, but her sign says simply &ldquo;Psychic.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>The practice of necromancy goes back as far as the ancient Assyrians and
            Babylonians and has continued through all the centuries since. In the Middle
            Ages it became associated with black magic; condemned by the church, it
            had to be practiced secretly. In Europe a necromancer might work in a remote
            graveyard at night, standing within a magical circle he had drawn to shield
            himself from the anger of the spirits. The grave of a person who had died
            suddenly or violently might be plundered for its body parts; the unused
            energy these were believed to contain made them valuable in the necromantic
            ceremony. But body parts aren't essential to necromancy, which is now
            practiced by channelers, mediums, and shamans, and even by groups of
            amateurs sitting around a Ouija board.</p>

        </p>
        <p>With its -polis ending, meaning &ldquo;city&rdquo; (see POLIS/POLIT), a necropolis is a
            &ldquo;city of the dead.&rdquo; Most of the famous necropolises of Egypt line the Nile
            River across from their cities. In ancient Greece and Rome, a necropolis
            would often line the road leading out of a city; in the 1940s a great Roman
            necropolis was discovered under the Vatican's St. Peter's Basilica. Some
            more recent cemeteries especially deserve the name necropolis because they
            resemble cities of aboveground tombs, a necessity in low-lying areas such as
            New Orleans where a high water table prevents underground burial.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Human autopsies are generally performed either to determine the cause of
            death or to observe the deadly effects of a disease for research or education
            purposes. Autopsies may be necessary when tracking an epidemic; they're
            also performed to discover whether a death might actually have resulted from
            murder, and if so, what evidence it might reveal that could help catch the
            murderer. Animal necropsies are actually more common than human
            autopsies, since a farmer with livestock is always concerned that whatever
            killed one animal not pose a threat to the others.</p>

        <p>PALEO comes from the Greek palaios, meaning &ldquo;ancient&rdquo;&mdash;that is, &ldquo;older

            paleobiology, for instance, deals with the biology of fossil organisms,
            paleogeography is the study of geography in earlier geological eras, and
            paleoecology is the study of the relationship of plants and animals to their

        <p>Paleolithic Of or relating to the earliest period of the Stone

        <p>&bull; He raves about the health benefits of his Paleolithic diet, the kind that our
            pre-agricultural, hunting-and-gathering Stone Age ancestors would have
            eaten.
        </p>
        <p>Since lithos means &ldquo;stone&rdquo; in Greek, the name Paleolithic was given to the
            older part of the Stone Age. The first known period of human culture, the
            Paleolithic actually covers almost all of human history, from the first use of
            stone tools around 2.5 million years ago until the invention of agriculture
            around 10,000 years ago. For almost all that time, humans used the very
            crudest of stone tools, produced by chipping away flakes of stone in order to
            make an edge for an ax or knife. Near the end of the period, animal bones and
            antlers were being used for tools, especially pointed tools, and sculpted
            figures and cave art were being produced. The Paleolithic gave way to the
            Mesolithic (&ldquo;Middle Stone Age&rdquo;) period, with its tools made of polished
            stone, wood, and bone.</p>

        <p>paleography (1) The study of ancient writings and

        <p>&bull; For her thesis on Central American paleography, she spent a winter in
            Honduras studying rock inscriptions 30 miles upriver from the nearest town.
        </p>
        <p>The world's oldest literature dates from about 4,000 years ago, from the land
            known as Sumer (now southern Iraq). Early writing took the form of
            pictographs, very simple pictures that first represented things or ideas and
            later came to represent actual words. The first actual alphabet, in which each
            character represents a sound, appeared in the same general region about 500
            years later. But writing developed in very different ways in different parts of
            the world, and 1,000 years later, when Europeans first arrived in the New
            World, alphabetic writing still wasn't being used anywhere in the Americas.
            Decoding some ancient languages has proven to be a huge task for
            paleographers, and determining the age and the source of a piece of writing
            can pose major challenges.</p>

        <p>paleontology A science dealing with the life of past

        <p>&bull; Her obsession with dinosaurs as a child continued through her teens, and no
            one was surprised when she started graduate school in paleontology.
        </p>
        <p>Until the 1820s, hardly anyone even suspected that dinosaurs had ever
            existed. In the years since, paleontology has sought to discover the entire
            history of life on earth, from the era of single-celled organisms up into the
            human era. Paleontologists continue to make remarkable discoveries, such as
            that a huge meteorite that fell in the Gulf of Mexico wiped out the dinosaurs
            &mdash;all except the birds, the only surviving dinosaurs. &ldquo;Radiometric dating&rdquo; can
            reveal the age (often tens of millions of years) of a rock or fossil or a tiny
            grain of pollen by measuring how much its radioactive elements have
            disintegrated. The study of molecules of DNA, RNA, and proteins has also
            become important for dating. Paleontologists often consult with geologists
            searching for oil, gas, and coal deposits, since all these &ldquo;fossil fuels&rdquo; were
            formed from plant and animal remains.</p>

        <p>&bull; His geological specialty was the beginning of the Paleozoic, from which the
            earliest fish fossils date.
        </p>
        <p>The Greek root zo- means &ldquo;animal,&rdquo; so names such as Paleozoic were
            invented to refer to a period in the development of animal life. For geologists,
            the Paleozoic era is followed by the Mesozoic (meso- meaning &ldquo;middle&rdquo;),
            which is followed by the Cenozoic (cen- meaning &ldquo;recent&rdquo;). Eras are huge
            stretches of time; geologists break eras down into smaller &ldquo;periods&rdquo; and
            &ldquo;epochs.&rdquo; Thus, the Paleozoic ends with the Permian period, the Mesozoic
            ends with the Upper Cretaceous epoch, and the Cenozoic ends with the
            Holocene epoch&mdash;the epoch in which we are living. The Paleozoic era
            produced the first fish, the first land plants, the first insects, and the first
            amphibians and reptiles; the dinosaurs, birds, and mammals had to wait for
            the Mesozoic.</p>

        <p>Attempts have been made to measure the circumference of the earth since the

            think he could reach China by sailing west more quickly than by sailing east.
            But that measurement had calculated the earth's circumference as about a
            quarter too small, and the rest is history. Columbus wasn't the only one who
            got it wrong; many later attempts continued to produce different
            measurements for the earth's circumference&mdash;even though the Greeks had
            calculated it correctly way back in the 3rd century B.C.</p>

        <p>In mythology, a person's attempts to circumvent fate are almost always

            disguised the boy as a woman. But clever Odysseus, recruiting for the Greek

            the women of the household he laid a sword. The young Achilles, ignoring

            minimalist stories always seemed to leave out any description of people's
            characters and motivation and rarely even described their surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>In the 1960s, a few composers, including Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and John
            Adams, began writing music inspired by the music of India and Southeast
            Asia, often with a quick pulsing beat and chords that are repeated quickly
            over and over while small changes are slowly introduced. Minimalist art,
            which began appearing around the same time, tries to strip away all personal
            elements, often leaving only pure geometric forms; you may have seen the
            plain silver boxes of Donald Judd, or the straight neon tubes of Bruce
            Nauman. In literature, the stripped-down fiction of Samuel Beckett and
            Raymond Carver is often considered minimalist. But there's a real question
            whether these various types of minimalism should even be considered the
            same concept.</p>

        <p>minuscule Very small.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; For someone who had been living on a minuscule budget since graduating
            from college, even the paycheck for a minimum-wage job felt like wealth to
            her.
        </p>
        <p>As a noun, minuscule means a style of ancient or medieval handwriting script
            with smaller letters than earlier scripts. There were actually several
            minuscules, but the most important was promoted from around A.D. 800 on
            by Charlemagne, who believed that any educated person in the Holy Roman
            Empire should be able to read the Latin written by anyone else. If you've ever
            looked at a medieval manuscript, you've probably seen minuscule script,
            along with so-called majuscule (for modern type, we would use the words
            lowercase and capital instead); even today most of us can read medieval
            minuscule and majuscule without too much trouble. Be careful about spelling
            minuscule; we tend to expect a word meaning &ldquo;small&rdquo; to begin with mini-
            rather than minu-.</p>

            with what she considers minutiae.
        </p>
        <p>As you might guess, this word comes straight from Latin. The Romans used
            it in its singular form, minutia, to mean &ldquo;smallness,&rdquo; and in the plural to mean
            &ldquo;trifles&rdquo;; today we almost always use it in the plural with that same &ldquo;trifles&rdquo;
            meaning. Hardly anyone ever talks about minutiae except to dismiss their
            importance. So you may talk about the minutiae of daily life or the minutiae
            of a contract, or about getting bogged down or buried in minutiae at the
            office. Just don't forget that the devil is often in the details.</p>

        <p>diminutive (1) Indicating small size. (2) Very small.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; In German, H&auml;nsel is a diminutive form of Hans (which is a diminutive
            form of Johannes), and Gretel is a diminutive form of Margaret.
        </p>
        <p>Just as diminish means &ldquo;to grow smaller,&rdquo; diminutive means &ldquo;very small.&rdquo;
            When writing about language, diminutive as both an adjective and a noun
            refers to particular endings and the words made with them to indicate
            smallness. In English, such endings include -et and -ette (piglet, dinette,
            cigarette, diskette) as well as -ie and -y (doggy, bootie, Bobby, Debbie).
            However, diminutives are more common in many other languages. Outside of
            language, diminutive is used for many things, including people (&ldquo;She noticed
            a diminutive figure standing shyly by the door&rdquo;), but often not very seriously
            (&ldquo;We were served some rather diminutive rolls&rdquo;).</p>

        <p>INTER comes straight from Latin. In English it has various meanings; all of
            them can be expressed broadly as &ldquo;between,&rdquo; but they're still quite distinct:
            &ldquo;moving between&rdquo; (intercity), &ldquo;communicating between&rdquo; (intercom),
            &ldquo;coming between&rdquo; (intercept), and so on. No wonder so many English words

        <p>&bull; He had interceded for her with their boss on one important occasion, for
            which she was still grateful.
        </p>
        <p>The Latin cedere means &ldquo;to go,&rdquo; so &ldquo;go between&rdquo; is the most literal meaning
            of intercede. (The same -cede root can also be seen in such words as precede
            and secede.) If you've been blamed unfairly for something, a friend may
            intercede on your behalf with your coach or teacher. More often, it will be the
            coach or teacher who has to intercede in a student dispute. The intercession
            of foreign governments has sometimes prevented conflicts from becoming
            worse than they otherwise would have.</p>

        <p>People often speak of interstices in the physical sense (referring to the
            interstices in surfaces, for example, or microscopic interstices between
            particles in chemical compounds), but also often in a less literal way (the
            interstices in a movie's plot, in the economy, in what's covered by a
            complicated tax law, etc.). The pronunciation of interstice is slightly unusual;
            you might not guess that it's accented on the second syllable. This is also true
            in the plural interstices, which is used more often than the singular form; note
            also that in interstices the final e is usually pronounced long, so that it rhymes

        <p>Interdict and interdiction are used for very serious prohibitions&mdash;more
            serious than, say, a professor telling the class that texting is forbidden during
            lectures. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, an interdict was a
            sentence imposed by the powerful Catholic Church forbidding a person or
            place, and sometimes even an entire country, from receiving church
            privileges or participating in church functions. Interdict now often means
            &ldquo;cut off&rdquo; in a physically forceful way as well; interdictions are usually
            targeted at either arms supplies or illegal drug shipments.</p>

            conversation is usually just an interruption. But in its older meaning,
            interpolating usually meant tampering with a text secretly to change its

            someone has quietly interpolated into their favorite bill at the last minute.

        <p>The Arab oil embargo of 1973 led airlines to add fuel surcharges to their
            passenger fares that were large enough to discourage air travel. Surcharges
            are usually added for special service. When you request a &ldquo;rush job&rdquo; from a
            service supplier, it will probably bring a surcharge along with it. A
            particularly difficult phone installation may carry a surcharge. An extra-large
            fine for a speeding offense after you've already had too many tickets could be
            called a surcharge. An added tax may be called a surcharge (or surtax) when
            it only affects people with incomes above a certain level. And if those low,
            low prices that show up in really big letters in ads for all kinds of services
            turn out to be misleading, it's probably because they don't include a bunch of

        </p>
        <p>In 1924 a group of European poets, painters, and filmmakers founded a
            movement that they called Surrealism. Their central idea was that the
            unconscious mind (a concept Sigmund Freud had recently made famous) was
            the source of all imagination, and that art should try to express its contents.
            The unconscious, they believed, revealed itself most clearly in dreams. The
            Surrealist painters included Ren&eacute; Magritte, Joan Mir&oacute;, and Salvador Dal&iacute;,
            whose &ldquo;limp watches&rdquo; painting became the best-known Surrealist image of
            all. Since those years, we've used surreal to describe all kinds of situations
            that strike us as dreamlike. And even though the Surrealist movement ended
            long ago, surrealism now seems to be everywhere&mdash;not just in painting,

        <p>cogeneration The production of electricity using
            waste heat (as in steam) from an industrial process, or the use of steam from
            electric power generation as a source of heat.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; With its new cogeneration system, the company reports converting over
            65% of the energy in natural gas to electricity, making this the most efficient
            power plant ever built.
        </p>
        <p>Cogeneration is basically the production of energy and usable heat (generally
            in the form of steam and hot water) in the same plant, usually by capturing
            heat that in older plants used to be simply wasted. It's one of the principal
            ways in which countries intend to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions so
            as to slow climate change. Cogeneration plants are often small, and the fuels
            used in them are varied. Lumber mills, for instance, can operate their own
            cogeneration plants, feeding them with wood scraps and sawdust, and
            wastewater treatment plants generate gas that can likewise be used as a
            source of energy. Since it's hard to move heat long distances, cogeneration is
            most efficient when the heat can be used nearby. Though the general public
            today knows little about cogeneration, more and more of us will be benefiting
            from it in the coming years.</p>

            relationship in which a person is controlled or manipulated by someone
            affected with a condition such as alcohol or drug addiction.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; She never knew what codependency was until her daughter took up with a
            mean, abusive alcoholic and refused to leave him.
        </p>
        <p>Dependency on addictive substances has been known for centuries, but the
            concept of codependency got its name only as recently as 1979. For many of
            us, codependency isn't easy to understand; we may keep asking &ldquo;Why doesn't
            she just leave him?&rdquo; and find it hard to accept the answers we get.
            Codependents usually don't share their partners' addiction, but their lives tend
            to be taken over with the burden of caring for and protecting the spouse or
            partner. In recent years, people have started claiming that all kinds of
            conditions&mdash;anorexia, overeating, gambling, fear of intimacy, etc.&mdash;can
            result in codependency. Many experts think all of this has gone too far; still,
            almost everyone agrees that spouses of alcoholics and drug addicts face
            unique difficulties and should look for support and advice anywhere they can
            find it.</p>

        <p>cohesion (1) The action or state of sticking together. (2)
            Molecular attraction by which the particles of a body are united throughout
            the mass.

        <p>&bull; The party's greatest strength was its cohesion and discipline, and on bill
            after bill that year not a single member voted with the other party.
        </p>
        <p>Cohesion is one of the noun forms of cohere; the others are cohesiveness and
            coherence, each of which has a slightly different meaning. Coherence is often
            used to describe a person's speech or writing. An incoherent talk or blog post
            is one that doesn't &ldquo;hang together&rdquo;; and if the police pick up someone who
            they describe as incoherent, it means he or she isn't making sense. But to
            describe a group or team that always sticks together, you would use cohesive,
            not coherent. And the words you'd use in Chemistry class to describe the way
            molecules hang together&mdash;for example, the way water forms into beads and
            drops&mdash;are cohesion, cohesive, and cohesiveness.</p>

        <p>SYN is a Greek and Latin prefix meaning &ldquo;together&rdquo; or &ldquo;at the same time.&rdquo;
            So &ldquo;in sync&rdquo; (short for &ldquo;in synchronization&rdquo;) means &ldquo;together in time.&rdquo;
            And a
            synonym is a word that can be considered together with another word since it
            has the same meaning.</p>

        <p>syntax The way in which words are put together to form phrases,

        <p>&bull; The president's critics complain about his odd and confusing syntax when
            he speaks in public.
        </p>
        <p>Syntax is basically about what word comes before and after another word; in
            other words, it's part of the larger subject of grammar. Syntax is often an
            issue in poetry, and it's usually discussed in connection with diction&mdash;that is,
            the poet's choice of words. So, for example, your English professor might
            point out the syntactic difference between &ldquo;Whose woods these are I think I
            know&rdquo; and &ldquo;I think I know whose woods these are&rdquo;; whereas if the discussion
            was about diction instead, the question might be about the choice of &ldquo;woods&rdquo;
            rather than &ldquo;land,&rdquo; or &ldquo;think&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;bet.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>synthesize To make something by combining different things.

        <p>&bull; From all the proposals put in front of us, we were asked to synthesize a plan
            that could get the support of the whole group.
        </p>
        <p>Synthesize is a very common word in chemistry, since chemists are
            constantly synthesizing new compounds&mdash;that is, synthetic compounds&mdash;
            including drugs and industrial chemicals. It's also often used when talking
            about writing; nonfiction writers must often synthesize large amounts of
            material from many sources to produce a book&mdash;which represents a synthesis
            of the important materials. An electronic synthesizercreates new sounds
            (which may imitate the sounds of acoustic instruments) by generating
            different basic tones and then manipulating and merging them together with
            others.</p>

        <p>synergy The increased effectiveness that results when two or
            more people or businesses work together.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; With the first company's importance in print media and the second's success
            on the Web, everyone was convinced that the merger would result in an
            awesome synergy.
        </p>
        <p>An old saying, &ldquo;The whole is greater than the sum of its parts,&rdquo; expresses the
            basic meaning of synergy. The word is sometimes used in a purely physical
            sense, especially when talking about drugs; sometimes a &ldquo;cocktail&rdquo; of drugs
            may be more effective than the sum of the effectiveness of each of the
            separate drugs. But the word is best known in the world of business. The
            notion that, when the right two companies merge, they'll produce a profitable
            synergy seemed exciting in the 1990s, when synergy became a trendy
            buzzword (even though it's actually been around since the 17th century). The
            idea of synergy was one factor in what became a &ldquo;merger mania&rdquo;;
            unfortunately, business synergy often turned out to be harder to achieve than
            to imagine.</p>

        <p>syndrome A group of signs and symptoms that occur together
            and characterize a particular abnormality or condition.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; When there is no trembling&mdash;the most obvious symptom of Parkinson's
            disease&mdash;most doctors fail to recognize the Parkinson's syndrome.
        </p>
        <p>Combining its two Greek roots, syndrome means basically &ldquo;running
            together.&rdquo; So when diagnosing a condition or disease, doctors tend to look for
            a group of symptoms existing together. As long as a set of symptoms remains
            mysterious, it may be referred to as a specific syndrome. But if that name is
            used for a while, it may become the condition's permanent name, even after
            an underlying cause has been found. So today we have Down syndrome,
            acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Asperger's syndrome, carpal tunnel
            syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, Tourette's syndrome, sick building
            syndrome, and many more. And since mental conditions often turn out to
            have physical causes, syndrome is used in psychology as well as in medicine.</p>

        <p>Adonis A very handsome young man.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Conversation in the little clusters of girls suddenly stops whenever this
            Adonis&mdash;blond, muscular, with an athlete's gait&mdash;swaggers down the school
            corridor.
        </p>
        <p>Adonis, like Narcissus (see narcissism), was a beautiful youth in Greek
            mythology. He was loved by both Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty, and
            Persephone, goddess of the underworld. One day while hunting, he was killed
            by a wild boar. In answer to Aphrodite's pleas, Zeus allowed him to spend
            half the year with her and half in the underworld. Today a man called an
            Adonis probably has strikingly fine features, low body fat, rippling muscles
            &mdash;and a certain vain attitude of overconfidence. Adonises should beware; the
            boar that killed Adonis was sent by either the jealous Artemis (goddess of
            hunting) or the envious Ares (god of war).</p>

        <p>amazon A tall, strong, often masculine woman.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; I was greeted by the team's captain, a robust, broad-shouldered amazon who
            gripped my hand with crushing force.
        </p>
        <p>In Greek mythology, an Amazon was a member of a race of women warriors.
            One of the famous labors of Heracles (Hercules) was to obtain the sash of the
            Amazon queen Hippolyta, and the hero Theseus married Hippolyta's sister.
            The Amazon River got its name when, in 1542, the first Europeans to
            descend the river were attacked by Indian warriors who, even at close range,
            they believed to be women. The mystery of these warriors continues to this
            day. However impressive a figure they cut, though, not every tall and strong
            woman today would take it as a compliment to be called an amazon.</p>

        <p>chimera An often grotesque creature of the imagination.

        <p>&bull; This latest piece of legislation is a weird chimera, with sections devoted to
            agriculture, defense, welfare, law enforcement, and scientific research.
        </p>
        <p>In Greek mythology, the Chimera was a fire-breathing she-monster with a
            lion's head, a goat's body, and a dragon's tail, which laid waste the
            countryside in southwestern Turkey. It was finally killed by the hero
            Bellerophon, whose flying horse, Pegasus, enabled him to attack from the air.
            Over time, chimera came to be used for any imaginary monster made up of
            strange and mismatched parts; today it's the name of several species of truly
            bizarre-looking fish. But more commonly a chimera is a fantasy, an illusion,
            a figment of the imagination, or a dream that will never come true.</p>

        <p>cornucopia (1) A container shaped like a hollow horn
            full of fruits, vegetables, and ears of grain. (2) An abundance of something
            desirable.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; These books were a cornucopia of wonderful stories and poems, and as a
            child I spent countless hours with them.
        </p>
        <p>The Latin term cornu copiae meant &ldquo;horn of plenty,&rdquo; and cornucopia and
            horn of plenty have both been used in English since the 16th century. Both
            terms refer to a hollow goat's horn, or a wicker basket shaped like one,
            overflowing with produce from the harvest. The cornucopia has been used as
            a decorative image to represent abundance since at least the 5th century B.C.,
            when it represented a gift given by the infant god Zeus to his beloved nurse: a
            broken goat's horn that would always magically be filled with whatever she
            wanted. In the U.S., cornucopias are often seen on altars, in store-window
            displays, and as table centerpieces, especially at harvesttime or Thanksgiving.</p>

        <p>Elysium A place or condition of ideal happiness; paradise.

        <p>&bull; They had named their estate Elysium, and as we gazed out over its
            fountains, ponds, and sweeping lawns we could see why.
        </p>
        <p>This word came into Latin from the Greek Elysion. In classical mythology,
            Elysium, or the Elysian fields, was the home of the blessed after death, the
            final resting place of the souls of the heroic and the pure. So it's easy to see
            how the word came to mean any place or state of bliss or delight. When we
            try to picture heaven, many of us probably see a lovely park; the great
            boulevard of Paris was named for the beautiful park that originally bordered

        <p>&bull; He reads trashy novels and watches junk on TV, but he has an epicure's love

        </p>
        <p>The Greek philosopher Epicurus was known for his original thinking about
            the nature of matter, but he's best remembered for his ideas about pleasure as
            the chief aim of life. By pleasure Epicurus chiefly meant the absence of pain
            and anxiety. However, over the years Epicureanism has come to mean a
            delight in fine sensual pleasures, and today an epicure is someone with
            refined taste, especially in food and wine. To display your own refined taste
            in language, you might try using epicure and epicurean in place of the

            it's known to English-speakers as Exodus, from the Greek exodos,
            &ldquo;departure.&rdquo; Leon Uris chose the name Exodus for his powerful novel about

        </p>
        <p>TOXI comes from the Greek and Latin words for &ldquo;poison,&rdquo; something the
            Greeks and Romans knew a good deal about. Socrates died by taking a
            solution of poison hemlock, a flowering plant much like wild carrot that now
            also grows in the U.S. Rome's enemy Mithridates, king of Pontus, was
            obsessed with poisons, experimented with them on prisoners, and tried to
            make himself immune to them by eating tiny amounts of them daily. Nero's
            mother Agrippina poisoned several of her son's rivals to power&mdash;and
            probably did the same to her own husband, the emperor Claudius.</p>

        <p>toxin A substance produced by a living organism (such as
            bacteria) that is highly poisonous to other organisms.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Humans eat rhubarb stems without ill effects, while cattle may die from
            eating the leaves, which seem to contain two different toxins.
        </p>
        <p>Long before chemists started creating poisons from scratch, humans were
            employing natural toxins for killing weeds and insects. For centuries South
            American tribes have used the toxin curare, extracted from a native vine, to
            tip their arrows. The garden flower called wolfsbane or monkshood is the
            source of aconite, an extremely potent toxin. The common flower known as
            jimsonweed contains the deadly poison scopolamine. And the castor-oil plant
            yields the almost unbelievably poisonous toxin called ricin. Today we hear
            health advisers of all kinds talk about ridding the body of toxins; but they're
            usually pretty vague about which ones they mean, and most of these &ldquo;toxins&rdquo;
            wouldn't be called that by biologists.</p>
        <p />

        <p />
        <p>toxicity The state of being poisonous; the degree to which
            something is poisonous.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Though they had tested the drug on animals, they suspected the only way to
            measure its toxicity for humans was by studying accidental human exposures.
        </p>
        <p>Toxicity is often a relative thing; in the words of a famous old saying, &ldquo;The
            dose makes the poison.&rdquo; Thus, it's possible to die from drinking too much
            water, and lives have been saved by tiny doses of arsenic. Even though
            botulinum toxin is the most toxic substance known, it's the basic ingredient in
            Botox, which is injected into the face to get rid of wrinkles. With some
            poisons, mere skin contact can be lethal; others are lethal when breathed into
            the lungs in microscopic amounts. To determine if a chemical will be
            officially called a poison, researchers often use the &ldquo;LD50&rdquo; test: If 50
            milligrams of the substance for every kilogram of an animal's body weight
            results in the death of 50% of test animals, the chemical is a poison. But there
            are problems with such tests, and toxicity remains a very individual concept.</p>

        <p>toxicology A science that deals with poisons and their
            effect.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; At medical school he had specialized in toxicology, hoping eventually to
            find work in a crime laboratory.
        </p>
        <p>Even though most of us are aware of toxicology primarily from crime shows
            on TV, toxicologists actually do most of their work in other fields. Many are
            employed by drug companies, others by chemical companies. Many work for
            the government, making sure the public is being kept safe from
            environmental poisons in the water, soil, and air, as well as unhealthy
            substances in our food and drugs. These issues often have to do with
            quantity; questions about how much of some substance should be considered
            dangerous, whether in the air or in a soft drink, may be left to toxicologists.
            But occasionally a toxicology task may be more exciting: for instance,
            discovering that what looked like an ordinary heart attack was actually
            brought on by a hypodermic injection of a paralyzing muscle relaxant.</p>

        <p>neurotoxin A poisonous protein that acts on the nervous
            system.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; From her blurred vision, slurred speech, and muscle weakness, doctors
            realized she had encountered a neurotoxin, and they suspected botulism.
        </p>
        <p>The nervous system is almost all-powerful in the body: all five senses depend
            on it, as do breathing, digestion, and the heart. So it's an obvious target for
            poisons, and neurotoxins have developed as weapons in many animals,
            including snakes, bees, and spiders. Some wasps use a neurotoxin to paralyze
            their prey so that it can be stored alive to be eaten later. Snake venom is often
            neurotoxic (as in cobras and coral snakes, for example), though it may
            instead be hemotoxic (as in rattlesnakes and coppermouths), operating on the
            circulatory system. Artificial neurotoxins, called nerve agents, have been
            developed by scientists as means of chemical warfare; luckily, few have ever
            been used.</p>

        <p>TEN/TENU comes from the Latin tenuis, meaning &ldquo;thin.&rdquo; So to extend
            something is to stretch it, and lots of things get thin when they're stretched.
            The ten- root is even seen in pretend, which once meant to stretch something
            out above or in front; that something came to be a claim that you were
            something that you actually weren't.</p>

        <p>tenuous Having little substance or strength; flimsy, weak.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; It's a rather tenuous theory, and the evidence supporting it has been
            questioned by several researchers.
        </p>
        <p>Something tenuous has been stretched thin and might break at any time. A
            person with a tenuous hold on his sanity should be watched carefully. If a
            business is only tenuously surviving, it will probably go bankrupt in the next
            recession. If there seems to be only a tenuous connection between two
            crimes, it means the investigators have more work to do.</p>

        <p>attenuated Thinned or weakened.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The smallpox shot is an injection of the virus in an attenuated form too
            weak to produce an actual case of smallpox.
        </p>
        <p>A friendship can become attenuated if neither person bothers to keep in
            touch. Radio waves can become attenuated by the shape of the landscape, by
            foliage, by atmospheric conditions, and simply by distance. Factory workers
            and rock musicians often use noise-attenuating ear plugs to save their
            hearing. To attenuate something isn't to stop it, just to tone it down.</p>

        <p>extenuating Partially excusing or justifying.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; A good college rarely accepts someone who has dropped out of high school
            twice, but in his case there were extenuating circumstances, including the
            death of both parents.
        </p>
        <p>Extenuating is almost always used today before &ldquo;circumstances.&rdquo; Extenuating
            circumstances are an important concept in the law. If you steal to feed your
            children, you're naturally less guilty than someone who steals just to get
            richer; if you kill someone in self-defense, that's obviously an extenuating
            circumstance that makes your act different from murder. Juries will usually
            consider extenuating circumstances (even when they're instructed not to), and
            most judges will listen carefully to an argument about extenuating
            circumstances as well. And they work outside of the courtroom as well; if
            you miss your daughter's performance in the middle-school pageant, she may
            forgive you if it was because you had to race Tigger to the vet's emergency
            room.</p>

        <p>distended Stretched or bulging out in all directions; swelled.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; All the children's bellies were distended, undoubtedly because of inadequate
            nutrition or parasites.
        </p>
        <p>Before giving you a shot, the nurse may wrap a rubber tube around your
            upper arm to distend the veins. When the heart isn't pumping properly, the
            skin of the feet and ankles may become distended. A doctor who notices that
            an internal organ has become distended will always want to find out the
            cause. As you can see, distended tends to be a medical term.</p>

        <p>technocrat A scientist or technical expert with power in

        </p>
        <p>&bull; The new president, a great fan of science, had surrounded himself with an
            impressive team of technocrats.
        </p>
        <p>In 1919 W. H. Smyth coined the term technocracy to mean basically
            &ldquo;management of society by technical experts.&rdquo; Technocracy grew into a
            movement during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when politicians and
            financial institutions were being blamed for the economic disaster, and fans
            of technocracy claimed that letting technical experts manage the country
            would be a great improvement. (They also suggested that dollars could be
            replaced by &ldquo;energy certificates&rdquo; representing energy units called ergs.)
            Today technocrat and technocratic are still popular words for experts with a
            highly rational and scientific approach to public policy issues. But these
            experts aren't always the best politicians, and when a terrific technological
            solution to a problem is opposed by a powerful group or industry, lawmakers
            find it easier to just ignore it.</p>

        <p>technophobe One who fears or dislikes advanced technology

        <p>&bull; The new employee was a middle-aged technophobe, who seemed startled
            every time a new page popped up on her computer screen.
        </p>
        <p>The condition known as technophobia got its name around 1965 (though its
            synonym Luddite had been around for a long time), and since then we've
            been flooded with electronic gadgetry. But even today few people actually
            understand any electrical technology more complicated than a lightbulb, so
            there's still plenty of technophobia around. And it isn't limited to computer
            users. The explosion of the atomic bomb made technophobes out of millions
            of people; and since human-caused climate change has been a result of
            technology, it's not surprising that it too has produced a technophobic
            response. But if technology turns out to be part of a solution, maybe that will
            change.</p>

        <p>&bull; Back in my day, the high-school technophiles subscribed to Popular
            Mechanics, built ham radios, and were always taking apart the engines of
            their clunkers.
        </p>
        <p>The word technophile came along soon after technophobe, which seemed to
            need an antonym. Its own synonyms include geek, gearhead, and propeller-
            head (for the characters in 1950s comic books who wore propeller beanies to
            indicate that they were sci-fi fans). Even before American inventors began
            amazing the world with their &ldquo;Yankee ingenuity&rdquo; in the 19th century, most
            Americans could be described as technology lovers. Today, American
            technophilia may be seen most vividly when a new version of a popular

            sports stars and dancers are often described as pyrotechnic, and a critic may
            describe the pyrotechnics of a rock guitarist's licks or a film's camerawork. A
            pyrotechnic performance is always impressive, but the word occasionally
            suggests something more like &ldquo;flashy&rdquo; or &ldquo;flamboyant.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>LONG comes from Latin longus, which, as you might guess, means &ldquo;long.&rdquo;
            The English word long shows up in many compound terms such as long-
            suffering (&ldquo;patiently enduring lasting offense or hardship&rdquo;) and long-winded
            (&ldquo;boringly long in speaking or writing&rdquo;), but the long- root also sometimes
            shows up less obviously. To prolong something is to lengthen it, for example,
            and a chaise longue (not lounge!) is &ldquo;a long reclining chair.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&bull; Checking the longitude, she was surprised to see that the tip of South
            America is actually east of New York City.
        </p>
        <p>The imaginary (but very important) lines of longitude run from the North
            Pole to the South Pole. Each is identified by the number of degrees it lies east
            or west of the so-called prime meridian in Greenwich, England (part of
            London). A circle is divided into 360&deg;; so, for example, the longitude of the
            Egyptian city of Cairo is about 31&deg;E&mdash;that is, about 31&deg; east of London. The
            &ldquo;long&rdquo; sense of the root may be easier to see in some uses of the adjective
            longitudinal: A longitudinal study is a research study that follows its subjects
            over many long years, and a longitudinal engine is one that drives a
            crankshaft that runs lengthwise under a vehicle (as in rear-wheel-drive cars)
            rather than crosswise.</p>

        <p>Elongate is often found in scientific writing, but the adjective elongated is
            more common, and frequently used to describe body parts in discussions of
            anatomy. This was even the case when the superhero Elongated Man made
            his appearance back in 1960. But some other characters with the same powers
            &mdash;Plastic Man, Elastic Lad, and Mr. Fantastic&mdash;ended up having longer

        <p>Longueur comes straight from French, a language based on Latin. When we
            borrow a foreign word, it's usually because English doesn't have a really good
            synonym, which is the case here. Longueur is used mostly when talking
            about books, but also when describing lectures and speeches. Like certain
            other French words, longueur tends to be used mainly by critics and
            professors&mdash;but lots of us who aren't either could find plenty of use for it too.</p>

        <p>Oblong is a general but useful term for describing the shape of things such as
            leaves. There's no such thing as an oblong circle, since a stretched circle has
            to be called an oval, and any rectangle that isn't square is oblong, at least if
            it's lying on its side (such rectangles can actually be called oblongs). Pills are
            generally oblong rather than round, to slide down the throat more easily. An
            oblong table will often fit a living space better than a square or round one
            with the same area. And people are always buried in oblong boxes.</p>

        <p>IDIO comes from the Greek idios, meaning &ldquo;one's own&rdquo; or &ldquo;private.&rdquo; In
            Latin this root led to the word idiota, meaning &ldquo;ignorant person&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a
            person who doesn't take in knowledge from outside himself. And that led to a
            familiar English word that gets used too often, usually to describe people who

        <p>&bull; As a teacher of foreign students, you can't use idioms like &ldquo;Beats me!&rdquo; and

            someone said he'd &ldquo;ride shotgun,&rdquo; did you wonder where the gun was? A
            modern English-speaker knows thousands of idioms, and uses many every
            day. Idioms can be completely ordinary (&ldquo;first off,&rdquo; &ldquo;the other day,&rdquo; &ldquo;make a

            the
            bullet,&rdquo; &ldquo;knuckle sandwich&rdquo;). A particular type of idiom, called a phrasal
            verb , consists of a verb followed by an adverb or preposition (or sometimes
            both); in make over, make out, and make up, for instance, notice how the

        <p>idiosyncrasy An individual peculiarity of a person's

        </p>
        <p>&bull; Mr. Kempthorne, whose idiosyncrasies are well known to most of us, has

            shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>Idiosyncrasies are almost always regarded as harmless. So, for example,
            filling your house with guns and Nazi posters might be called something
            stronger than idiosyncratic. But if you always arrange your Gummi candies
            in table form by color and type, then eat them in a special order starting with
            the pterodactyls (purple ones must die first!), you might qualify. Harmless

            tell people about; most Americans are careful to hide their idiosyncrasies,
            since our culture doesn't seem to value odd behavior. The British, however,

        <p>Words with the -pathy suffix generally name a disease or condition (see

            describe any medical condition that no one has yet figured out. Most facial
            tics are called idiopathic by doctors, since no cause can be found. Other well-
            known conditions, including chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel
            syndrome, and fibromyalgia, still perplex the medical community. And even
            though doctors expect that the causes of all of them will eventually be found,
            and that those causes will turn out to be the same for hundreds of thousands
            of people, the conditions are still called idiopathic.</p>

        <p>Shakespeare himself may have coined this word, in Othello, and later he gave
            the name Ariel to the famous air-spirit character in The Tempest. An aerialist
            is an acrobat who performs high above the audience. In painting, aerial
            perspective is the way an artist creates the illusion that a mountain or city is
            far away (something that early painters only slowly learned how to do),
            usually by making it slightly misty and bluish gray&mdash;as if seen through miles
            of air. An aerial work platform, or &ldquo;cherry picker,&rdquo; supports a worker at a
            high elevation on the end of a crane. And aerial itself can be used as a noun,

        <p>Aerobic exercise is exercise that takes an extended amount of time&mdash;usually
            ten minutes or more&mdash;but is usually performed at only moderate intensity.
            Running, swimming, bicycling, and cross-country skiing are classic aerobic
            exercises. In 1968 a best-selling book called Aerobics introduced a system of
            exercise for increasing the body's ability to take in and use oxygen, and today
            aerobics classes, often mimicking such outdoor exercise as running and
            bicycling, take place every afternoon in thousands of gyms and YMCAs
            across the country. Aerobic exercise particularly strengthens the heart and
            lungs, but usually has many other good effects as well. Aerobic bacteria,
            which need oxygen to live, are essential for breaking down living matter so
            that it returns to the soil. They include the famous intestinal E. coli, as well as
            the staph and strep bacteria that can make a visit to the hospital risky.</p>

        <p>In Greek, the prefix a- or an- means &ldquo;not&rdquo; or &ldquo;without,&rdquo; and bios means
            &ldquo;life.&rdquo; Anaerobic sports and exercise, such as gymnastics, weight lifting, and
            sprinting, are of high intensity but short duration, so they don't involve much
            oxygen intake. Anaerobic exercise triggers a different type of cell activity
            from aerobic exercise. As a result, it doesn't do much for your heart and lungs
            and it doesn't burn off fat; what it does do is build muscle. Anaerobic bacteria
            are bacteria that live without oxygen. They're responsible for several nasty
            conditions, including tetanus, gangrene, botulism, and food poisoning. They
            often live in deep wounds, so a bad dog bite&mdash;or, even worse, a human bite&mdash;
            can be dangerous, since the mouth is full of anaerobic bacteria. But most
            anaerobic bacteria are harmless, and many are essential to our lives.</p>

        <p>CAD comes from the Latin verb cadere, &ldquo;to fall.&rdquo; Thus, a cascade is usually
            a waterfall, but sometimes a flood of something else that seems to pour on
            top of you: a cascade of new problems, a cascade of honors, and so on.</p>

        <p>cadaver A dead body, especially one that is to be dissected; a
            corpse.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The cadaver she was given to work on, from the Manhattan morgue, was
            that of an unclaimed homeless woman.
        </p>
        <p>Since a corpse is a body that has &ldquo;fallen down dead,&rdquo; the root cad- seems at
            home here. For most of us, cadaver has an impersonal sound, and indeed the
            word is often used for a body whose identity isn't important: most medical
            students probably don't spend much time wondering who they're dissecting.
            Someone with cadaverous features looks like a corpse before he or she is

        <p>decadent Marked by decay or decline, especially in morals.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The French empire may have been at its most decadent just before the
            French Revolution.
        </p>
        <p>To be decadent is to be in the process of decay, so a powerful nation may be
            said to be in a decadent stage if its power is fading. But the word is more
            often used to speak of moral decay. Ever since the Roman empire, we've
            tended to link Rome's fall to the moral decay of its ruling class, who indulged
            in extreme luxuries and unwholesome pleasures while providing the public
            with cruel spectacles such as the slaughter of the gladiators. But not everyone
            agrees on what moral decadence looks like (or even how it might have
            hastened the fall of Rome), though most people think it involves too many
            sensual pleasures&mdash;as, for instance, among the French and English poets and
            artists of the 1880s and '90s called the Decadents. These days, for some
            reason, people have decided decadent is the way to describe rich chocolate
            cakes.</p>

        <p>cadence (1) The close of a musical phrase, especially one that
            moves to a harmonic point of rest. (2) The rhythmic flow of sound in
            language.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; As the piano came to a cadence, the singer ascended to a beautiful high
            note, which she held for several seconds until the piano came in again in a
            new key.
        </p>
        <p>Most of us hear the ending of a piece of music as a fall to a resting place,
            even if the melody ends on a high note. And that's the way endings were
            being heard way back in the 16th century, when cadence first began to be
            used in English for musical endings. Most cadences are harmonic &ldquo;formulas&rdquo;
            (standard harmonic patterns that we've all heard thousands of times) and we
            don't expect them to be original; so whether you're consciously aware of it or
            not, a cadential passage is usually quite recognizable. When cadence means
            &ldquo;speech rhythm,&rdquo; its cad- root refers to the way the accents &ldquo;fall.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>cadenza A virtuosic flourish or extended passage by a soloist,
            often improvised, that occurs shortly before the end of a piece or movement.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Each of her arias was greeted with greater applause, but it was the brilliant
            improvised cadenza of her final number that brought down the house.
        </p>
        <p>A concerto is a large piece for an instrumental soloist (usually playing piano
            or violin) and orchestra. Concertos are often extremely demanding for the
            soloist, but the most difficult part of all may be the cadenza, when the
            orchestra drops out completely, leaving the soloist to dazzle the audience
            with a set of flourishes, often completely original, right before a movement
            ends. Cadenzas are also heard in many vocal arias, especially those of the
            18th century. The word, borrowed from Italian, originally meant &ldquo;cadence&rdquo;;
            thus, the cadenza, even if it lasts for a couple of minutes, is essentially a
            decoration of the final important harmonic cadence of the piece.</p>

        <p>TRIB comes from the Latin tribuere, meaning &ldquo;to give&rdquo; or &ldquo;to pay.&rdquo; So a
            group that distributes food passes it out to those in need, and when you
            contribute to the group you give your money or energy to it.</p>

        <p>tribute (1) Something (such as a gift or speech) that is given or
            performed to show appreciation, respect, or affection. (2) Something that
            proves the good quality or effectiveness of something.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; Near the end of his speech, he paid tribute to the two pioneers in the field
            who were in the audience.
        </p>
        <p>Tribute originally took the form of things given from a weaker group to the
            dominant power of a region&mdash;a bit like the &ldquo;protection money&rdquo; the Mafia
            gets from small businesses after making them offers they can't refuse, though
            the older form of tribute actually did buy the weaker group some protection
            from enemy forces. Tribute could come in the form of valuables, cattle, or
            even produce, and might include the loan of warriors to strengthen the ruler's
            army. But when we &ldquo;pay tribute&rdquo; today, it's generally in the form of praise.
            And when we say, for instance, that a successful school &ldquo;is a tribute to&rdquo; the
            vision of its founder, we mean that its success is itself a form of praise for the
            person who founded it. And a &ldquo;tribute band&rdquo; is a rock group intended to
            honor a great band of the past.</p>

        <p>tributary A stream flowing into a larger stream or a lake.
        </p>
        <p>&bull; The entire expedition had perished of fever attempting to reach the source
            of one of the Amazon's great tributaries.
        </p>
        <p>A tributary was originally a person or state that owed tribute to a more
            powerful person or state. Ancient China, for instance, had dozens of tributary
            states, and the emperor would receive elephants from Siam or young girls
            from Korea as tribute. Just as a smaller power gave some of its wealth to a
            larger power, a small river contributes its waters to a larger one. A tributary
            can be a tiny stream, but some are immense rivers. The Missouri River, for
            example, could be called a tributary to the Mississippi, even though it's about
            2,500 miles long and receives hundreds of tributaries itself.</p>

        <p>&bull; He attributed his long life to a good sense of humor and a glass of wine with
            lunch and dinner every day.
        </p>
        <p>Attribute means something rather similar to &ldquo;pay tribute.&rdquo; So, for example, an
            award winner who pays tribute to an inspiring professor is, in a sense,
            attributing her success to the professor. Though if you attribute your fear of
            dogs to an incident in your childhood, you're not exactly praising the nasty
            dog that bit you way back when. The second sense of attribute is slightly
            different: If you attribute bad motives to a politician, it means you think he or
            she is doing things for the wrong reasons (even if you don't have any proof).
            When attribute is accented on its first syllable, it's being used as a noun,
            usually as a synonym for quality. So, for instance, you may believe that an
            even temper is an attribute of the best presidents, or that cheerfulness is your
            spouse's best attribute.</p>

            And indeed we usually use it when talking about personal revenge, whether
            it's retribution for an insult in a high-school corridor or retribution for a
            guerrilla attack on a government building. But retribution isn't always so
            personal: God takes &ldquo;divine retribution&rdquo; on humans several times in the Old
            Testament, especially in the great Flood that wipes out almost the entire
            human race. And retribution for criminal acts, usually in the form of a prison
            sentence, is taken by the state, not the victims.</p>

            and had the power to quiet the rough December waters around Sicily for
            about two weeks&mdash;the &ldquo;halcyon days.&rdquo; Thus the adjective halcyon came to
            mean calm and serene. Today people especially use it to describe a golden

        <p>&bull; A little-used trail meanders through the mountains, crossed by cowpaths
            onto which hikers often stray and get lost.
        </p>
        <p>Now and then, geography contributes an ordinary word to the language. The
            Greek word maiandros came from the Maiandros River (now the Menderes
            River) in western Turkey, which rises in the mountains and flows 240 miles
            into the Aegean Sea. Meandering is a natural tendency especially in slow-
            moving rivers on flat ground with fine-grained sand, and the Maiandros was
            well known for its many windings and wanderings. Roads and trails, like
            rivers, can be said to meander, but so can relaxed music, lazy writing, and

        <p>oedipal Relating to an intense emotional relationship with one's

        </p>
        <p>&bull; Already on her first visit she sensed a tense oedipal situation, with her
            boyfriend and his father barely getting through dinner without coming to
            blows.
        </p>
        <p>In Greek mythology, the king of Thebes, in response to a dreadful prophecy,
            abandoned his infant son Oedipus, who was then brought up by shepherds.
            Grown to manhood, Oedipus slew his father almost accidentally, not
            recognizing him, and then married his mother. When the shameful truth was
            discovered, the mother committed suicide and Oedipus blinded himself and
            went into exile. The psychiatrist Sigmund Freud invented the term Oedipus
            complex to mean a sexual desire that a child normally feels toward the parent
            of the opposite sex, along with jealous feelings toward the parent of the same
            sex. In Freud's theory (not accepted by everyone today), lingering oedipal
            feelings are an essential source of adult personality disorder, and can result in
            choosing a spouse who closely resembles your father or mother.</p>

            broken pottery, the Greek equivalent of scrap paper&mdash;and the process was
            known as ostrakizein. Today the most common kind of ostracism is exclusion

            Roman orator Cicero delivered a series of speeches against Mark Antony,
            which soon became known as the philippica or orationes philippicae, since
            they were modeled on Demosthenes' attacks. Splendid though both men's

        <p>Satyrs, the minor forest gods of Greek mythology, had the face, torso, and

            pleasures associated with Dionysus (or Bacchus), the god of wine, they were
            full of playful and sometimes violent energies, and spent much of their time
            chasing the beautiful nature spirits known as nymphs. Satyrs show up over
            and over in ancient art. The Greek god Pan, with his reed pipes and
            mischievous delight in life, had the appearance and character of a satyr but
            greater powers. Notice how satyr is pronounced; it's quite different from

        <p>In the 1st century A.D., a fanatical sect arose in Judaea to oppose the Roman
            domination of Palestine. Known as the Zealots, they fought their most
            famous battle at the great fortress of Masada, where 1,000 defenders took
            their own lives just as the Romans were about to storm the fort. Over the
            years, zealot came to mean anyone who is passionately devoted to a cause.

            etc.). But zealot (like its synonym fanatic) and zealotry (like its synonym
            fanaticism) are used disapprovingly&mdash;even while Jews everywhere still honor
            the memory of those who died at Masada.</p>

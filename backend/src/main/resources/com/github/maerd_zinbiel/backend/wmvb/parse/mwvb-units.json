It was St. Benedict who organized the first Christian monasteries; many Christians have been baptized Benedict in his honor, and 16 popes have taken it as their papal name.","root":null},{"spell":"benefactor","explain":"Someone who helps another person or group, especially by giving money.","sentence":{"text":"An anonymous benefactor had given $15 million to establish an ecological institute at the university.","word":null},"detail":"A benefactor may be involved in almost any field. One may endow a scholarship fund; another may give money to expand a library; still another may leave a generous sum to a hospital in her will. The famous benefactions of John D. Rockefeller included the gifts that established the University of Chicago, the Rockefeller Foundation, and Rockefeller University. Many benefactors have reported that giving away their money turned out to be the most rewarding thing they ever did.","root":null},{"spell":"beneficiary","explain":"A person or organization that benefits or is expected to benefit from something, especially one that receives money or property when someone dies.","sentence":{"text":"Living in a trailer in near-poverty, she received word in the mail that her father had died, naming her as the sole beneficiary of his life-insurance policy.","word":null},"detail":"Beneficiary is often used in connection with life insurance, but it shows up in many other contexts as well. A college may be the beneficiary of a private donation. Your uncle's will may make a church his sole beneficiary, in which case all his money and property will go to it when he dies. A “third-party beneficiary” of a contract is a person (often a child) who the people signing the contract (which is usually an insurance policy or an employee-benefit plan) want to benefit from it. In a more general way, a small business may be a beneficiary of changes to the tax code, or a restaurant may be the beneficiary when the one across the street closes down and its whole lunch crowd starts coming in.","root":null},{"spell":"benevolence","explain":"Kindness, generosity.","sentence":{"text":"In those financially desperate years, the young couple was saved only by the benevolence of her elderly great-uncle.","word":null},"detail":"Part of benevolence comes from the Latin root meaning “wish.” The novels of Charles Dickens often include a benevolent figure who rescues the main characters at some point—Mr. Brownlow in Oliver Twist, Abel Magwitch in David Copperfield, Mr. Jarndyce in Bleak House, Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol. To be benevolent, it helps to have money, but it's not necessary; kind assistance of a nonfinancial sort may turn out to be lifesaving benevolence as well.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"AM","description":"AM comes from the Latin amare, “to love.” The Roman god of love was known by two different names, Cupid and Amor.

So we often speak of an amicable meeting or an amicable settlement. When amicable describes more personal relations, it may indicate a rather formal friendliness. But it's always nice when two friends who've been quarreling manage to have an amicable conversation and to say amicable good-byes at the end.","root":null},{"spell":"enamored","explain":"Charmed or fascinated; inflamed with love.","sentence":{"text":"Rebecca quickly became enamored of the town's rustic surroundings, its slow pace, and its eccentric characters.","word":null},"detail":"Computer hackers are always enamored of their new programs and games. Millions of readers have found themselves enamored with Jane Austen's novels. And Romeo and Juliet were, of course, utterly enamored of each other. But we also often use the word in negative contexts: A friend at work may complain that she's not enamored of the new boss, and when you start talking about how you're not enamored with the neighbors it may be time to move. (Note that both of and with are commonly used after enamored.)","root":null},{"spell":"amorous","explain":"Having or showing strong feelings of attraction or love.","sentence":{"text":"It turned out that the amorous Congressman had gotten his girlfriend a good job and was paying for her apartment.","word":null},"detail":"A couple smooching on a park bench could be called amorous, or a young married couple who are always hugging and kissing. But the word is often used a bit sarcastically, as when a tabloid newspaper gets hold of some scandalous photos and calls the participants “the amorous pair.” In such cases, we may be encouraged to think the attraction is more physical than emotional.","root":null},{"spell":"paramour","explain":"A lover, often secret, not allowed by law or custom.","sentence":{"text":"He had been coming to the house for two years before her brothers realized that he was actually the paramour of their shy and withdrawn sister.","word":null},"detail":"Paramour came to English from French (a language based on Latin), though the modern French don't use the word. Since par amour meant “through love,” it implies a relationship based solely on love, often physical love, rather than on social custom or ceremony. So today it tends to refer to the lover of a married man or woman, but may be used for any lover who isn't obeying the social rules.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"BELL","description":"BELL comes from the Latin word meaning “war.” Bellona was the little- known Roman goddess of war; her husband, Mars, was the god of war.","words":[{"spell":"antebellum","explain":"Existing before a war, especially before the American Civil War (1861–65).","sentence":{"text":"When World War I was over, the French nobility found it impossible to return to their extravagant antebellum way of life.","word":null},"detail":"Even countries that win a war often end up worse off than they had been before, and the losers almost always do. So antebellum often summons up images of ease, elegance, and entertainment that disappeared in the postwar years. In the American South, the antebellum way of life depended on a social structure, based on slavery, that collapsed after the Civil War; Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind shows the nostalgia and bitterness felt by wealthy Southerners after the war more than the relief and anticipation experienced by those released from slavery. In Europe, World War I shattered the grand life of the upper classes, even in victorious France and Britain, and changed society hugely in the space of just four years.","root":null},{"spell":"bellicose","explain":"Warlike, aggressive, quarrelsome.","sentence":{"text":"The more bellicose party always got elected whenever there was tension along the border and the public believed that military action would lead to security.","word":null},"detail":"Since bellicose describes an attitude that hopes for actual war, the word is generally applied to nations and their leaders. In the 20th century, it was commonly used to describe such figures as Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm, Italy's Benito Mussolini, and Japan's General Tojo, leaders who believed their countries had everything to gain by starting wars. The international relations of a nation with a bellicose foreign policy tend to be stormy and difficult, and bellicosity usually makes the rest of the world very uneasy.","root":null},{"spell":"belligerence","explain":"Aggressiveness, combativeness.","sentence":{"text":"The belligerence in Turner's voice told them that the warning was a serious threat.","word":null},"detail":"Unlike bellicose and bellicosity, the word belligerence can be used at every level from the personal to the global. The belligerence of Marlon Brando's performances as the violent Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire electrified the country in the 1940s and '50s. At the same time, belligerent speeches by leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States throughout the Cold War were keeping the world on edge. Belligerent is even a noun; the terrible war in the Congo in recent years, for example, has involved seven nations as belligerents.","root":null},{"spell":"rebellion","explain":"Open defiance and opposition, sometimes armed, to a person or thing in authority.","sentence":{"text":"A student rebellion that afternoon in Room 13 resulted in the new substitute teacher racing out of the building in tears.","word":null},"detail":"Plenty of teenagers rebel against their parents in all kinds of ways. But a rebellion usually involves a group. Armed rebellions are usually put down by a country's armed forces, or at least kept from expanding beyond a small area. The American War of Independence was first viewed by the British as a minor rebellion that would soon run its course, but this particular rebellion led to a full-fledged revolution—that is, the overthrow of a government. Rebellion, armed or otherwise, has often alerted those in power that those they control are very unhappy.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"PAC","description":"PAC is related to the Latin words for “agree” and “peace.” The Pacific Ocean—that is, the “Peaceful Ocean”—was named by Ferdinand Magellan because it seemed so calm after he had sailed through the storms near Cape Horn. (Magellan obviously had never witnessed a Pacific typhoon.)","words":[{"spell":"pacify","explain":"(1) To soothe anger or agitation. (2) To subdue by armed action.","sentence":{"text":"It took the police hours to pacify the angry demonstrators.","word":null},"detail":"Someone stirred up by a strong emotion can usually be pacified by some kind words and the removal of its causes. Unhappy babies are often given a rubber pacifier for sucking to make them stop crying. During the Vietnam War, pacification of an area meant using armed force to drive out the enemy, which might be followed by bringing the local people over to our side by building schools and providing social services. But an army can often bring “peace” by pure force, without soothing anyone's emotions.","root":null},{"spell":"pacifist","explain":"A person opposed to war or violence, especially someone who refuses to bear arms or to fight, on moral or religious grounds.","sentence":{"text":"Her grandfather had fought in the Marines in World War II, but in his later years he had become almost a pacifist, opposing every war for one reason or another.","word":null},"detail":"The Quakers and the Jehovah's Witnesses are pacifist religious groups, and Henry David Thoreau and Martin Luther King are probably the most famous American pacifists. Like these groups and individuals, pacifists haven't always met with sympathy or understanding. Refusing to fight ever, for any reason, calls for strong faith in one's own moral or religious convictions, since pacifism during wartime has often gotten people persecuted and even thrown in prison.","root":null},{"spell":"pact","explain":"An agreement between two or more people or groups; a treaty or formal agreement between nations to deal with a problem or to resolve a dispute.","sentence":{"text":"The girls made a pact never to reveal what had happened on that terrifying night in the abandoned house.","word":null},"detail":"Pact has “peace” at its root because a pact often ends a period of unfriendly relations. The word is generally used in the field of international relations, where diplomats may speak of an “arms pact,” a “trade pact,” or a “fishing- rights pact.” But it may also be used for any solemn agreement or promise between two people; after all, whenever two parties shake hands on a deal, they're not about to go to war with each other.","root":null},{"spell":"pace","explain":"Contrary to the opinion of.","sentence":{"text":"She had only three husbands, pace some Hollywood historians who claim she had as many as six.","word":null},"detail":"This word looks like another that is much more familiar, but notice how it's pronounced. It is used only by intellectuals, and often printed in italics so that the reader doesn't mistake it for the other word. Writers use it when correcting an opinion that many people believe; for example, “The costs of the program, pace some commentators, will not be significant.” So what does pace have to do with peace? Because it says “Peace to them (that is, to the people I'm mentioning)—I don't want to start an argument; I just want to correct the facts.”","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"CRIM","description":"CRIM comes from the Latin words for “fault or crime” or “accusation.” It's obvious where the root shows up most commonly in English. A crime is an act forbidden by the government, which the government itself will punish you for, and for which you may be branded a criminal. A crime is usually more serious than a tort (see TORT), a “civil wrong” for which the wronged person must himself sue if he wants to get repaid in some way.","words":[{"spell":"criminology","explain":"The study of crime, criminals, law enforcement, and punishment.","sentence":{"text":"His growing interest in criminology led him to become a probation officer.","word":null},"detail":"Criminology includes the study of all aspects of crime and law enforcement —criminal psychology, the social setting of crime, prohibition and prevention, investigation and detection, capture and punishment. Thus, many of the people involved—legislators, social workers, probation officers, judges, etc.—could possibly be considered criminologists, though the word usually refers only to scholars and researchers.","root":null},{"spell":"decriminalize","explain":"To remove or reduce the criminal status of.","sentence":{"text":"An angry debate over decriminalizing doctor-assisted suicide raged all day in the statehouse.","word":null},"detail":"Decriminalization of various “victimless crimes”—crimes that don't directly harm others, such as private gambling and drug-taking—has been recommended by conservatives as well as liberals, who often claim that it would ease the burden on the legal system, decrease the amount of money flowing to criminals, and increase personal liberty. Decriminalization is not the same as legalization; decriminalization may still call for a small fine (like a traffic ticket), and may apply only to use or possession of something, leaving the actual sale of goods or services illegal.","root":null},{"spell":"incriminate","explain":"To show evidence of involvement in a crime or a fault.","sentence":{"text":"The muddy tracks leading to and from the cookie jar were enough to incriminate them.","word":null},"detail":"Testimony may incriminate a suspect by placing him at the scene of a crime, and incriminating evidence is the kind that strongly links him to it. But the word doesn't always refer to an actual crime. We can say, for instance, that a virus has been incriminated as the cause of a type of cancer, or that video games have been incriminated in the decline in study skills among young people.","root":null},{"spell":"recrimination","explain":"(1) An accusation in answer to an accusation made against oneself. (2) The making of such an accusation.","sentence":{"text":"Their failure to find help led to endless and pointless recriminations over responsibility for the accident.","word":null},"detail":"Defending oneself from a verbal attack by means of a counterattack is as natural as physical self-defense. So a disaster often brings recriminations among those connected with it, and divorces and child-custody battles usually involve recriminations between husband and wife. An actual crime isn't generally involved, but it may be; when two suspects start exchanging angry recriminations after they've been picked up, it often leads to one of them turning against the other in court.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"PROB","description":"PROB comes from the Latin words for “prove or proof” and “honesty or integrity.” A probe, whether it's a little object for testing electrical circuits or a spacecraft headed for Mars, is basically something that's looking for evidence or proof. And probable originally described something that wasn't certain but might be “provable.”","words":[{"spell":"approbation","explain":"A formal or official act of approving; praise, usually given with pleasure or enthusiasm.","sentence":{"text":"The senate signaled its approbation of the new plan by voting for it unanimously.","word":null},"detail":"Approbation is a noun form of approve, but approbation is usually stronger than mere approval. An official commendation for bravery is an example of approbation; getting reelected to office by a wide margin indicates public approbation; and the social approbation received by a star quarterback in high school usually makes all the pain worthwhile.","root":null},{"spell":"probate","explain":"The process of proving in court that the will of someone who has died is valid, and of administering the estate of a dead person.","sentence":{"text":"When her father died, she thought she would be able to avoid probate, but she wasn't that lucky.","word":null},"detail":"Ever since people have written wills, those wills have had to be proven genuine by a judge. Without a probate process, greedy acquaintances or relatives could write up a fake will stating that all the person's wealth belonged to them. To establish a will as genuine, it must generally be witnessed and stamped by someone officially licensed to do so (though wills have sometimes been approved even when they were just written on a piece of scrap paper, with no witnesses). Today we use probate more broadly to mean everything that's handled in probate court, a special court that oversees the handling of estates (the money and property left when someone dies), making sure that everyone eventually receives what is properly theirs.","root":null},{"spell":"probity","explain":"Absolute honesty and uprightness.","sentence":{"text":"Her unquestioned probity helped win her the respect of her fellow judges.","word":null},"detail":"Probity is a quality the public generally hopes for in its elected officials but doesn't always get. Bankers, for example, have traditionally been careful to project an air of probity, even though banking scandals and bailouts have made this harder than ever. An aura of probity surrounds such public figures as Warren Buffett and Bill Moyers, men to whom many Americans would entrust their children and their finances.","root":null},{"spell":"reprobate","explain":"A person of thoroughly bad character.","sentence":{"text":"His wife finally left him, claiming he was a reprobate who would disappear for weeks at a time, gambling and drinking away all his money.","word":null},"detail":"The related verb of reprobate is reprove, which originally, as the opposite of approve, meant “to condemn.” Thus, a reprobate, as the word was used in Biblical translations, was someone condemned to hell. But for many years reprobate has been said in a tone of joshing affection, usually to describe someone of doubtful morals but good humor. Shakespeare's great character Falstaff—a lazy, lying, boastful, sponging drunkard—is the model of a reprobate, but still everyone's favorite Shakespeare character.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"GRAV","description":"GRAV comes from the Latin word meaning “heavy, weighty, serious.” Gravity is, of course, what makes things heavy, and without it there wouldn't be any life on earth, since nothing would stay on earth at all.

(2) Serious and formal in appearance or manner.","sentence":{"text":"We realized that the situation was grave and that the slightest incident could spark all-out war.","word":null},"detail":"Gravity has a familiar physical meaning but also a nonphysical meaning— basically “seriousness.” Thus, something grave possesses gravity. You can refer to the gravity of a person's manner, though public figures today seem to have a lot less gravity than they used to have. Or you can talk about a grave situation, as in the example sentence. But even though Shakespeare makes a pun on grave when a dying character talks about being buried the next day (“Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man”), the word meaning “hole for burying a body” isn't actually related.","root":null},{"spell":"gravitas","explain":"Great or very dignified seriousness.","sentence":{"text":"The head of the committee never failed to carry herself with the gravitas she felt was appropriate to her office.","word":null},"detail":"This word comes to us straight from Latin. Among the Romans, gravitas was thought to be essential to the character and functions of any adult (male) in authority. Even the head of a household or a low-level official would strive for this important quality. We use gravitas today to identify the same solemn dignity in men and women, but it seems to come easier in those who are over 60, slow-moving—and a bit overweight.","root":null},{"spell":"gravitate","explain":"To move or be drawn toward something, especially by natural tendency or as if by an invisible force.","sentence":{"text":"On hot evenings, the town's social life gravitated toward the lakefront, where you could stroll the long piers eating ice cream or dance at the old Casino.","word":null},"detail":"To gravitate is to respond, almost unconsciously, to a force that works like gravity to draw things steadily to it as if by their own weight. Thus, young people gravitate toward a role model, moths gravitate to a flame, a conversation might gravitate toward politics, and everyone at a party often gravitates to the bar.","root":null},{"spell":"aggravate","explain":"(1) To make (an injury, problem, etc.) more serious or severe. (2) To annoy or bother.","sentence":{"text":"She went back to the soccer team before the knee was completely healed, which naturally aggravated the injury.","word":null},"detail":"Since the grav- root means basically “weighty or serious,” the original meaning of aggravate was “to make more serious.” A bad relationship with your parents can be aggravated by marrying someone who nobody likes, for example, or a touchy trade relationship between two countries can be aggravated by their inability to agree on climate-change issues. Depression can be aggravated by insomnia—and insomnia can be aggravated by depression. But when most people use aggravate today, they employ its “annoy” sense, as in “What really aggravates my dad is having to listen to that TV all day long.”","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"LEV","description":"LEV comes from the Latin adjective levis, meaning “light,” and the verb levare, meaning “to raise or lighten.” So a lever is a bar used to lift something, by means of leverage.

(2) The act or result of lifting or raising someone or something.","sentence":{"text":"Her doctor is concerned about the elevation of her blood pressure since her last visit.","word":null},"detail":"When you're hiking, you may be interested in knowing the highest elevation you'll be reaching. Psychologists use the term “mood elevation” to mean improvement in a patient's depression, and some leg ailments require elevation of the limb, usually so that it's higher than the heart for part of each day. Elevation can also mean “promotion”; thus, a vice president may be elevated to president, or a captain may be elevated to admiral.","root":null},{"spell":"cantilever","explain":"A long piece of wood, metal, etc., that sticks out from a wall to support something above it.","sentence":{"text":"The house's deck, supported by cantilevers, jutted out dramatically over the rocky slope, and looking over the edge made him dizzy.","word":null},"detail":"Cantilevers hold up a surface or room without themselves being supported at their outer end. Many outdoor balconies are cantilevered, and theater balconies may be as well. A cantilevered bridge may have a huge span (as long as 1,800 feet) built out on either side of a single large foundation pier. Architects sometimes use cantilevered construction to produce dramatic effects; Frank Lloyd Wright's “Fallingwater” house, which extends out over a rocky river, is a famous example. But the Grand Canyon's “Skywalk” has become perhaps the best-known piece of cantilevered construction in America.","root":null},{"spell":"levity","explain":"Lack of appropriate seriousness.","sentence":{"text":"The Puritan elders tried to ban levity of all sorts from the community's meetings, but found it increasingly difficult to control the younger generation.","word":null},"detail":"Levity originally was thought to be a physical force exactly like gravity but pulling in the opposite direction, like the helium in a balloon. As recently as the 19th century, scientists were still arguing about its existence. Today levity refers only to lightness in manner. To stern believers of some religious faiths, levity is often regarded as almost sinful.

In the Greek war against Troy, he killed several great warriors before being slain by Achilles. His name began to take on its current meaning only after gangs of bullying young rowdies, many of them armed soldiers recently released from service following the end of the English Civil War, began terrorizing the residents of late-17th-century London. The gangs took such names as the Roysters, the Blades, the Bucks, and the Bloods, but the best-known of them was called the Hectors.

The ancient Epicureans and the 19th-century Utilitarians both taught and pursued hedonistic principles. But although we generally use the word today when talking about immediate pleasures for the senses, philosophers who talk about hedonism are usually talking about quiet pleasures that aren't pursued in a selfish way.","root":null},{"spell":"nestor","explain":"A senior figure or leader in one's field.","sentence":{"text":"The guest of honor was a nestor among journalists, and after dinner he shared some of his wisdom with the audience.","word":null},"detail":"Nestor was another character from the Iliad, the eldest of the Greek leaders in the Trojan War.

Physical training was required for both men and women. A boy would begin his military training at 7 and would live in army barracks for much of his life, even after he was married.

Stoicism taught that humans should seek to free themselves from joy, grief, and passions of all kinds in order to attain wisdom; its teachings thus have much in common with Buddhism. The great Stoics include the statesman Cicero, the playwright Seneca, and the emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose Meditations is the most famous book of Stoic philosophy.

Megalomania has probably afflicted many rulers throughout history: The Roman emperor Caligula insisted that he be worshipped as a living god. Joseph Stalin suffered from the paranoia that often accompanies megalomania, and had thousands of his countrymen executed as a result. J.- B. Bokassa, dictator of a small and extremely poor African nation, proclaimed himself emperor of the country he renamed the Central African Empire.

Egomaniacs may display a grandiose sense of self-importance, with fantasies about their own brilliance or beauty, intense envy of others, a lack of sympathy, and a need to be adored or feared. But, like megalomaniac, the word egomaniac is thrown around by lots of people who don't mean much more by it than blowhard or know-it-all.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"PSYCH","description":"PSYCH comes from the Greek word psyche, meaning “breath, life, soul.” Psychology is the science of mind and behavior, and a psychologist treats or studies the mental problems of individuals and groups.

In Greek mythology, Psyche was a beautiful princess who fell in love with Eros (Cupid), god of love, and went through terrible trials before being allowed to marry him. The story is often understood to be about the soul redeeming itself through love. (To the Greeks, psyche also meant “butterfly,” which suggests how they imagined the soul.) In English, psyche often sounds less spiritual than soul, less intellectual than mind, and more private than personality.","root":null},{"spell":"psychedelic","explain":"(1) Of or relating to a drug (such as LSD) that produces abnormal and often extreme mental effects such as hallucinations.

The other well-known psychedelics are psilocybin (likewise obtained from fungi) and mescaline (obtained from peyote cactus). How psychedelics produce their effects is still fairly mysterious, partly because research ceased for almost 20 years because of their reputation, but scientists are determined to find the answers and much research is now under way. Psychedelics are now used to treat anxiety in patients with cancer, and are being tested in the treatment of such serious conditions as severe depression, alcoholism, and drug addiction.","root":null},{"spell":"psychosomatic","explain":"Caused by mental or emotional problems rather than by physical illness.","sentence":{"text":"Her doctor assumed her stomach problems were psychosomatic but gave her some harmless medication anyway.","word":null},"detail":"Since the Greek word soma means “body,” psychosomatic suggests the link between mind and body. Since one's mental state may have an important effect on one's physical state, research on new medicines always involves giving some patients in the experiment a placebo (fake medicine), and some who receive the sugar pills will seem to improve. You may hear someone say of someone else's symptoms, “Oh, it's probably just psychosomatic,” implying that the physical pain or illness is imaginary—maybe just an attempt to get sympathy—and that the person could will it away if he or she wanted to. But this can be harsh and unfair, since, whatever the cause is, the pain is usually real.","root":null},{"spell":"psychotherapist","explain":"One who treats mental or emotional disorder or related bodily ills by psychological means.","sentence":{"text":"He's getting medication from a psychiatrist, but it's his sessions with the psychotherapist that he really values.","word":null},"detail":"Many psychologists offer psychological counseling, and psychological counseling can usually be called psychotherapy, so many psychologists can be called psychotherapists. The most intense form of psychotherapy, called psychoanalysis, usually requires several visits a week. A competing type of therapy known as behavior therapy focuses on changing a person's behavior (often some individual habit such as stuttering, tics, or phobias) without looking very deeply into his or her mental state.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"CEPT","description":"CEPT comes from the Latin verb meaning “take, seize.” Capture, which is what a captor has done to a captive, has the same meaning.

So at a formal reception, guests are received or welcomed or “taken in.” A bad TV reception means the signal isn't being received well. When a new novel receives good reviews, we say it has met with a good critical reception. If it gets a poor reception, on the other hand, that's the same as saying that it wasn't well-received.","root":null},{"spell":"intercept","explain":"To stop, seize, or interrupt (something or someone) before arrival.","sentence":{"text":"The explosives had been intercepted by police just before being loaded onto the jet.","word":null},"detail":"Since the prefix inter means “between” (see INTER), it's not hard to see how intercept was created. Arms shipments coming to a country are sometimes intercepted, but such interceptions can sometimes be understood as acts of war. In football, soccer, and basketball, players try to intercept the ball as it's being passed by the other team. In years gone by, letters and documents being carried between officers or officials were sometimes intercepted when the carrier was caught; today, when these communications are generally electronic, an intercepted e-mail isn't actually stopped, but simply read secretly by a third party.","root":null},{"spell":"perceptible","explain":"Noticeable or able to be felt by the senses.","sentence":{"text":"Her change in attitude toward him was barely perceptible, and he couldn't be sure he wasn't just imagining it.","word":null},"detail":"Perceptible includes the prefix per-, meaning “through,” so the word refers to whatever can be taken in through the senses. A perceptive person picks up minor changes, small clues, or hints and shades of meaning that others can't perceive, so one person's perception—a tiny sound, a slight change in the weather, a different tone of voice—often won't be perceptible to another.","root":null},{"spell":"susceptible","explain":"(1) Open to some influence; responsive. (2) Able to be submitted to an action or process.","sentence":{"text":"She impressed everyone immediately with her intelligence, so they're now highly susceptible to her influence and usually go along with anything she proposes.","word":null},"detail":"With its prefix sus-, “up,” susceptible refers to something or someone that “takes up” or absorbs like a sponge. A sickly child may be susceptible to colds, and an unlucky adult may be susceptible to back problems. A lonely elderly person may be susceptible to what a con man tells him or her on the phone.

Someone confined to a bedroom or a wheelchair is too ill or disabled to be anywhere else. A person under “house arrest” is confined to his or her house by the government. At a business meeting, the discussion may be confined to a single topic. A town may keep industrial development confined to one area by means of zoning.

(2) Specifying perfectly or precisely.","sentence":{"text":"The team's brilliant research provided a definitive description of the virus and its strange mutation patterns.","word":null},"detail":"Something definitive is complete and final. A definitive example is the perfect example. A definitive answer is usually a strong yes or no. A definitive biography contains everything we'll ever need to know about someone. Ella Fitzgerald's famous 1950s recordings of American songs have even been called definitive—but no one ever wanted them to be the last.","root":null},{"spell":"finite","explain":"Having definite limits.","sentence":{"text":"Her ambitions were infinite, but her wealth was finite.","word":null},"detail":"It has come as a shock to many of us to realize that resources such as oil— and the atmosphere's ability to absorb greenhouse gases—are finite rather than unlimited. The debate continues as to whether the universe is finite or infinite and, if it's finite, how to think about what lies beyond it. Religion has always concerned itself with the question of the finite (that is, human life on earth) versus the infinite (God, eternity, and infinity).

When Antonie van Leeuwenhoek invented the microscope in the 17th century, he was able to see organisms that had been thought too infinitesimally small to exist. But today's electron microscope allows us to see infinitesimal aspects of matter that even Leeuwenhoek could not have imagined.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"JECT","description":"JECT comes from jacere, the Latin verb meaning “throw” or “hurl.” To reject something is to throw (or push) it back; to eject something is to throw (or drive) it out; and to inject something is to throw (or squirt) it into something else.","words":[{"spell":"interject","explain":"To interrupt a conversation with a comment or remark.","sentence":{"text":"His anger was growing as he listened to the conversation, and every so often he would interject a crude comment.","word":null},"detail":"According to its Latin roots, interject ought to mean literally “throw between.” For most of the word's history, however, the only things that have been interjected have been comments dropped suddenly into a conversation. Interjections are often humorous, and sometimes even insulting, and the best interjections are so quick that the conversation isn't even interrupted.","root":null},{"spell":"conjecture","explain":"To guess.","sentence":{"text":"He was last heard of in Bogotá, and they conjectured that he had met his end in the Andes at the hands of the guerrillas.","word":null},"detail":"Formed with the prefix con-, “together,” conjecture means literally “to throw together”—that is, to produce a theory by putting together a number of facts. So, for example, Columbus conjectured from his calculations that he would reach Asia if he sailed westward, and his later conjecture that there was a “Northwest Passage” by sea from the Atlantic to the Pacific over the North American continent was proved correct centuries later.","root":null},{"spell":"projection","explain":"An estimate of what might happen in the future based on what is happening now.","sentence":{"text":"The president has been hearing different deficit projections all week from the members of his economic team.","word":null},"detail":"Projection has various meanings, but what they all have in common is that something is sent out or forward. A movie is projected onto a screen; a skilled actress projects her voice out into a large theater without seeming to shout; and something sticking out from a wall can be called a projection. But the meaning we focus on here is the one used by businesses and governments. Most projections of this kind are estimates of a company's sales or profits—or of the finances of a town, state, or country—sometime in the future.","root":null},{"spell":"trajectory","explain":"The curved path that an object makes in space, or that a thrown object follows as it rises and falls to earth.","sentence":{"text":"Considering the likely range, trajectory, and accuracy of a bullet fired from a cheap handgun at 100 yards, the murder seemed incredible.","word":null},"detail":"Formed with part of the prefix trans-, “across,” trajectory means a “hurling across.” By calculating the effect of gravity and other forces, the trajectory of an object launched into space at a known speed can be computed precisely. Missiles stand a chance of hitting their target only if their trajectory has been plotted accurately. The word is used most often in physics and engineering, but not always; we can also say, for example, that the trajectory of a whole life may be set in a person's youth, or that a new book traces the long trajectory of the French empire.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"TRACT","description":"TRACT comes from trahere, the Latin verb meaning “drag or draw.” Something attractive draws us toward it.

We usually use the word for a piece of farm machinery, but it's also the name of the part of a big truck that includes the engine and the cab. Tractors get terrific traction, because of their powerful engines and the deep ridges on their huge wheels. A cross-country skier needs traction to kick herself forward, but doesn't want it to slow her down when she's gliding, so the bottom of the skis may have a “fish-scale” surface that permits both of these at the same time.","root":null},{"spell":"retract","explain":"(1) To pull back (something) into something larger. (2) To take back (something said or written).","sentence":{"text":"She was forced to retract her comment about her opponent after it was condemned in the press.","word":null},"detail":"The prefix re- (“back”) gives retract the meaning of “draw back.” Just as a cat retracts its claws into its paws when they aren't being used, a public figure may issue a retraction in order to say that he or she no longer wants to say something that has just been said. But it's sometimes hard to know what a retraction means: Was the original statement an error or an outright lie? Sometimes a politician even has to retract something that everyone actually assumes is the truth. Thousands of citizens were forced to publicly retract their “wrong” ideas by the Soviet government in the 1930s and the Chinese government in the 1960s. Someone wrongly accused may demand a retraction from his accuser—though today it seems more likely that he'll just go ahead and sue.","root":null},{"spell":"protracted","explain":"Drawn out, continued, or extended.","sentence":{"text":"No one was looking forward to a protracted struggle for custody of the baby.","word":null},"detail":"With its prefix pro-, “forward,” protracted usually applies to something drawn out forward in time. A protracted strike may cripple a company; a protracted rainy spell may rot the roots of vegetables; and a protracted lawsuit occasionally outlives the parties involved. Before the invention of the polio vaccines, polio's many victims had no choice but to suffer a protracted illness and its aftereffects.","root":null},{"spell":"intractable","explain":"Not easily handled, led, taught, or controlled.","sentence":{"text":"Corruption in the army was the country's intractable problem, and for many years all foreign aid had ended up in the colonels' pockets.","word":null},"detail":"Intractable simply means “untreatable,” and even comes from the same root. The word may describe both people and conditions. A cancer patient may suffer intractable pain that doctors are unable to treat. An intractable alcoholic goes back to the bottle immediately after “drying out.” Homelessness, though it hardly existed thirty years ago, is now sometimes regarded as an intractable problem.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"DUC/DUCT","description":"DUC/DUCT from the Latin verb ducere, “to lead,” shows up regularly in English.

A cozy living room may be conducive to relaxed conversation, just as a boardroom may be conducive to more intense discussions. Particular tax policies are often conducive to savings and investment, whereas others are conducive to consumer spending.

(2) The reaching of a conclusion by reasoning.","sentence":{"text":"Foretelling the future by deduction based on a political or economic theory has proved to be extremely difficult.","word":null},"detail":"To deduct is simply to subtract. A tax deduction is a subtraction from your taxable income allowed by the government for certain expenses, which will result in your paying lower taxes. Your insurance deductible is the amount of a medical bill that the insurance company makes you subtract before it starts to pay—in other words, the amount that will come out of your own pocket. But deduction also means “reasoning,” and particularly reasoning based on general principles to produce specific findings. Mathematical reasoning is almost always deduction, for instance, since it is based on general rules. But when Dr. Watson exclaims “Brilliant deduction, my dear Holmes!” he simply means “brilliant reasoning,” since Sherlock Holmes's solutions are based on specific details he has noticed rather than on general principles.","root":null},{"spell":"induce","explain":"(1) Persuade, influence. (2) Bring about.","sentence":{"text":"To induce him to make the call we had to promise we wouldn't do it again.","word":null},"detail":"Inducing is usually gentle persuasion; you may, for instance, induce a friend to go to a concert, or induce a child to stop crying. An inducement is something that might lure you to do something, though inducements are occasionally a bit menacing, like the Godfather's offer that you can't refuse. Induce also sometimes means “produce”; thus, doctors must at times induce labor in a pregnant woman.

(2) Attraction or charm.","sentence":{"text":"The company began its campaign of seduction of the smaller firm by inviting its top management to a series of weekends at expensive resorts.","word":null},"detail":"Seduction, with its prefix se-, “aside,” means basically “lead aside or astray.” In Hawthorne's novel The Scarlet Letter, Hester Prynne is forced to wear a large scarlet A, for “adulteress,” after it is revealed that she's been seduced by the Reverend Dimmesdale. Seduction also takes less physical forms.

Most novels and films move sequentially, but some use techniques such as flashbacks that interrupt the movement forward in time. Sequential courses in college must follow each other in the proper order, just like sequential tasks or steps.","root":null},{"spell":"subsequent","explain":"Following in time, order, or place; later.","sentence":{"text":"Through all her subsequent love affairs, she never stopped thinking about the man who got away.","word":null},"detail":"The prefix sub- normally means “below,” and the sub- in subsequent seems to imply that everything after the first is somehow inferior. As the definition states, subsequent can refer to time (“All our subsequent attempts to contact her failed”), order (“The subsequent houses on the list looked even worse”), or place (“The subsequent villages on the river heading east become steadily more primitive”). But subsequently, as in “I subsequently learned the real story,” simply means “later.”","root":null},{"spell":"consequential","explain":"(1) Resulting. (2) Important.","sentence":{"text":"None of our discussions thus far has been very consequential; next week's meeting will be the important one.","word":null},"detail":"Something consequential follows or comes along with something else. The “resulting” meaning of consequential is usually seen in legal writing. For example, “consequential losses” are losses that supposedly resulted from some improper behavior, about which the lawyer's client is suing.

It was Aristotle who identified the non sequitur as one of the basic fallacies of logic—that is, one of the ways in which a person's reasoning may go wrong. For Aristotle, the non sequitur is usually a conclusion that doesn't actually result from the reasoning and evidence presented.

Partly because of the writings of Nietzsche, we now often think of Apollo (in contrast to the god Dionysus) as a model of calm reason, and we may call anything with those qualities Apollonian.

The festivities were originally secret, and only initiated members could participate. There was wine in abundance, and participants were expected to cut loose from normal restraints and give in to all sorts of wild desires.

The Greeks consulted the oracle frequently on matters both private and public. The prophecies were given in difficult poetry that had to be interpreted by priests, and even the interpretations could be hard to understand. When Croesus, king of Lydia, asked what would happen if he attacked the Persians, the oracle announced that he would destroy a great empire; what she didn't say was that the empire destroyed would be his own.

He was the inventor of wine, which he gave to the human race. For that gift and for all the wild behavior that it led to, Dionysus became immensely popular, and he appears in a great many myths. He is often shown holding a wine goblet, with his hair full of vine leaves, and attended by a band of goat-footed satyrs and wild female spirits called maenads. In the 19th century, scholars such as Nietzsche claimed that the ancient world could be understood as a continuing conflict between the attitudes represented by Apollo (see Apollonian) and Dionysus— that is, between order and disorder, between moderation and excess, between the controlled and the ecstatic.","root":null},{"spell":"jovial","explain":"Jolly, good-natured.","sentence":{"text":"Their grandfather was as jovial and sociable as their grandmother was quiet and withdrawn.","word":null},"detail":"Jove, or Jupiter, was the Roman counterpart of the Greek's Zeus, and like Zeus was regarded as chief among the gods. When the Romans were naming the planets, they gave the name Jupiter to the one that, as they may have already known, was the largest of all (though only the second-brightest to the naked eye).

Olympus, which allowed them to watch what went on in the human realm below and intervene as they saw fit. They insisted on being properly worshipped by humans, but otherwise tended to treat the affairs of these weak and short-lived creatures almost like a sport. So Olympian describes someone who seems “lofty” and “above it all,” as if surveying a scene in which other people appear the size of ants.

They rely on their host plants merely for physical support, not nourishment. Tropical epiphytes include orchids, ferns, and members of the pineapple family. To a newcomer in the tropical rain forest, the first sight of a great tree with large epiphytes hanging from every level can be eerie and astonishing.

Sometimes the added name follows a given name, as in Erik the Red or Billy the Kid. In other cases, the epithet precedes the personal name, as in Mahatma (“Great-souled”) Gandhi. In still others, it's used in place of the actual name, as in El Greco (“The Greek”) or El Cid (“The Lord”). In its other common meaning, an epithet is a mocking or insulting name (like “Lackland” in the example sentence).

Even though it's easy to joke about hypochondriacs, hypochondria is no joking matter for the sufferer. Somewhat surprisingly, the second part of hypochondria derives from chondros, the Greek word for “cartilage.” The cartilage in question is that of the sternum, or breastbone. From ancient times, doctors believed that certain internal organs or regions were the seat of various diseases, both physical and mental, and the area under the breastbone was thought to be the source of hypochondria.","root":null},{"spell":"hypoglycemia","explain":"Abnormal decrease of sugar in the blood.","sentence":{"text":"She had been controlling her hypoglycemia through diet and vitamins, but she now realized she needed to add daily exercise as well.","word":null},"detail":"The root glyk- means “sweet” in Greek, so glyc shows up in the names of various terms referring to a sugar as a chemical ingredient, such as glycerine and monoglyceride. People with diabetes have difficulty controlling the sugar in their blood. Too little can be dangerous; its early symptoms may be as minor as nervousness, shaking, and sweating, but it can lead to seizures and unconsciousness. Luckily, it can be taken care of easily by eating or drinking something high in carbohydrates. Its opposite, hyperglycemia (see HYPER), is the main symptom of diabetes, and usually requires an injection of insulin, which the sufferer usually gives himself.

So a hypothesis is something you assume to be true in order that you can use it as the base or basis for a line of reasoning—and any such assumption can be called hypothetical. So, for example, the theory that the dinosaurs became extinct because of a giant meteor that struck the earth near the Yucatán Peninsula involves the hypothesis that such a collision would have had such terrible effects on the earth's climate that the great reptiles would have been doomed.

Thermal imaging is photography that captures “heat pictures”—rather than ordinary light pictures—of objects.

The original nuclear explosives, detonated in 1945, were so-called fission bombs, since they relied on the fission, or splitting, of the nuclei of uranium atoms. But an even greater source of destructive power lay in nuclear fusion, the forcing together of atomic nuclei. The light and heat given off by stars such as the sun come from a sustained fusion—or thermonuclear—reaction deep within it. On earth, such thermonuclear reactions were used to develop the hydrogen bomb, a bomb based on a fusion reaction that merged hydrogen atoms to become helium atoms. The thermonuclear era, which began in 1952, produced bombs hundreds of times more powerful than those exploded at the end of World War II. Why the thermo- in thermonuclear?

Air conditioners, furnaces, and stoves are generally rated by BTUs. (Though “BTUs” is often short for “BTUs per hour”; in air-conditioner ratings, for instance, “BTUs” really means “BTUs of cooling capacity per hour.”) Fuels such as natural gas and propane are also compared using BTUs. The BTU first appeared in 1876 and isn't part of the metric system—the metric unit of energy is the much smaller joule—so it isn't much used by scientists, but its practicality keeps it popular for consumer goods and fuels.

The types of tumor known as polyps got their name because some seem to be attached to the surface by branching “foot”- like roots, even though most do not.

The order of mammals called Insectivora contains the shrews, moles, and hedgehogs, though bats and anteaters are also insectivores. Many insects are themselves insectivores; the dragonfly, for instance, is a swift insectivorous terror that lives up to its name. But it's the insectivorous plants that tend to fascinate us; of the over 600 species, the best known are the Venus flytrap (which snaps shut on its prey), the pitcher plants (which drown insects in a tiny pool of water), and the sundews (which capture insects with their sticky surfaces).","root":null},{"spell":"voracious","explain":"Having a huge appetite.","sentence":{"text":"One of the hardest parts of dieting is watching skinny people with voracious appetites consume large amounts of food without gaining weight.","word":null},"detail":"Voracious can be applied to people, animals, and even things, and doesn't always refer to consuming food.

But the two words function a little differently today. A forerunner may simply come before another thing, but a precursor generally paves the way for something.

Because someone once thought that a family tree, or genealogical chart, resembled a crane's foot (in French, pied de grue), even though cranes' feet only have four talons or claws, no more than any other bird, while a family tree may have hundreds of branches. The word pedigree is usually used for purebred animals—cats, racehorses, and dogs, as well as livestock such as cows and sheep.

But the adjective sense of pedestrian as defined here is actually its original meaning. To be pedestrian was to be drab or dull, as if plodding along on foot rather than speeding on horseback or by coach. Pedestrian is often used to describe a colorless or lifeless writing style, but it can also describe politicians, public tastes, personal qualities, or possessions.

Someone or something that's frequently criticized is often said to be “much maligned,” which suggests that the criticism isn't entirely fair or deserved.

After the decline of the Roman empire these cemeteries were forgotten, not to be rediscovered until 1578. Catacomb has come to refer to different kinds of underground chambers and passageways. The catacombs of Paris are abandoned stone quarries that were not used for burials until 1787.

The catalytic converter in your car's exhaust system, for instance, uses tiny amounts of platinum to swiftly convert the engine's dangerous gases to carbon dioxide and water vapor.

Protocol comes from a Greek word for the first sheet of a papyrus roll. In English, protocol originally meant “a first draft or record,” and later specifically the first draft of a diplomatic document, such as a treaty. The “diplomatic” connection led eventually to its current meaning of “rules of behavior.” Someone wearing Bermuda shorts and sandals to a state dinner at the White House would not be acting “according to protocol,” and royal protocol forbids touching the queen of England except to shake her hand.

Pronouns are often used in order not to repeat a noun (so instead of saying “Sheila turns 22 tomorrow, and Sheila is having a party,” we replace the second “Sheila” with “she”). But sloppy writers sometimes leave their antecedents unclear (for instance, “Sheila helps Kathleen out, but she doesn't appreciate it,” where it isn't clear who “she” is). Watch out for this possible problem when using not just he and she but also they, them, it, this, and that. And keep in mind that antecedent isn't just a grammar term.

When capitalized, as in Orthodox Judaism, Orthodox refers to a branch within a larger religious organization that claims to honor the religion's original or traditional beliefs. The steadfast holding of established beliefs that is seen in religious orthodoxy is apparent also in other kinds of orthodox behavior.

For More, the suffix -topia meant “place” (see TOP), and u- (from the Greek root ou) meant “no,” but also perhaps “good” (see EU). In other words, More's Utopia was too good to be true. It's probably no accident that dystopia was first used around 1950, soon after George Orwell published his famous novel Nineteen Eighty-Four and 16 years after Aldous Huxley published Brave New World. These two are still the most famous of the 20th century's many depressingly dystopian novels. And what about all those bleak futuristic films: Blade Runner, Brazil, The Matrix, and the rest?

Dyspepsia can be caused by many diseases, but dyspeptic individuals are often the victims of their own habits and appetites.

The term usually describes lines of reasoning or arguments that proceed from the general to the particular, or from causes to effects. Whereas a posteriori knowledge is knowledge based solely on experience or personal observation, a priori knowledge is knowledge that comes from the power of reasoning based on self-evident truths.

In the days when buying and selling was carried on in the local marketplace, the rule was a practical one. Buyer and seller knew each other and were on equal footing. The nature of modern commerce and technology placed the buyer at a disadvantage, however, so a stack of regulations have been written by federal, state, and local agencies to protect the consumer against dangerous or defective products, fraudulent practices, and the like.

Though the two words originally had about the same meaning, today inquisition tends to remind us of the Spanish Inquisition, an ongoing trial conducted by church-appointed inquisitors that began in the Middle Ages and sought out nonbelievers, Jews, and Muslims, thousands of whom were sentenced to torture and to burning at the stake.","root":null},{"spell":"perquisite","explain":"(1) A privilege or profit that is provided in addition to one's base salary.

A perquisite, often called simply a perk, is instead something of value that the holder of a particular job or position is entitled to, usually without even asking. The President of the United States, for instance, enjoys as perquisites the use of Camp David and Air Force One.

And America often makes successfully acquisitive people into heroes; even Ebenezer Scrooge, that model of miserly greed and acquisitiveness, was once defended by a White House chief of staff.

For example, under the U.S. Constitution, the Congress has plenary power to wage war, which means that no one else—not the courts, not the states, not the president—has any power whatsoever to second-guess Congress about warmaking. But in recent years, that hasn't stopped some presidents from starting conflicts that looked a lot like wars to most people.

We think of salt as the complement of pepper (maybe mostly because of their colors), and the right necktie is a perfect complement to a good suit. Complement can also mean “the full quantity, number, or amount”; thus, a ship's complement of officers and crew is the whole force necessary for full operation.

Basic metric units include the kilogram (the basic unit of weight), the liter (the basic unit of volume), and of course the meter (the basic unit of length—see below).

(2) A systematic rhythm in poetry or music.","sentence":{"text":"The basic meter of the piece was 3/4, but its rhythms were so complicated that the 3/4 was sometimes hard to hear.","word":null},"detail":"Meter is a metric measurement slightly longer than a yard; thus, a 100-meter dash might take you a second longer than a 100-yard dash. But the word has a different sense in music, where people aren't separated by whether they use the metric system. For a musician, the meter is the regular background rhythm, expressed by the “time signature” written at the beginning of a piece or section: 2/2, 2/4, 3/8, 4/4, 6/8, etc. Within a meter, you can create rhythms that range from the simple to the complex. So, for example, “America the Beautiful” is in 4/4 meter (or “4/4 time”), but so are most of the rhythmically complex songs written by Paul Simon, Burt Bacharach, or Stevie Wonder. In ordinary conversation, though, most people use “rhythm” to include meter and everything that's built on top of it.

We don't normally think of auditors as listening, since looking at and adding up numbers is their basic line of work, but auditors do have to listen to people's explanations, and perhaps that's the historical link.

For instance, many dogs have great auditory (not acoustic) powers, and the auditory nerve lets us hear by connecting the inner ear to the brain. Acoustic and acoustical instead refer especially to instruments and the conditions under which sound can be heard; so architects concern themselves with the acoustic properties of an auditorium, and instrument makers with those of a clarinet or piano.","root":null},{"spell":"audition","explain":"A trial performance to evaluate a performer's skills.","sentence":{"text":"Auditions for Broadway shows attract so many hopeful unknown performers that everyone in the business calls them “cattle calls.”","word":null},"detail":"Most stars are discovered at auditions, where a number of candidates read the same part and the director chooses. Lana Turner famously skipped the audition process and was instead discovered by an agent sipping a soda in a Sunset Boulevard café at age 16. Audition can also be a verb; so, for example, after Miss Turner gained her stardom, actors had to audition to be her leading man.

In 1947 a plane piloted by Chuck Yeager burst the “sound barrier” and created the first sonic boom. In the decades afterward sonic booms became a familiar sound to Americans.

Early in the 20th century, composers such as Arnold Schoenberg and his students developed the use of dissonance in music as a style in itself. But to many listeners, the sounds in such music are still unbearable, and most continue to prefer music based on traditional tonality. Dissonant is now often used without referring to sound at all. Cognitive dissonance, for example, is what happens when you believe two different things that can't actually both be true.","root":null},{"spell":"resonance","explain":"(1) A continuing or echoing of sound.

Violins made by the Italian masters Stradivari and Guarneri possess a quality of resonance that later violinmakers have never precisely duplicated. And you may have noticed how a particular note will start something in a room buzzing, as one of the touching surfaces begins to resonate with the note. Because of that, resonance and resonate—along with the adjective resonant—aren't always used to describe sound.

Ultrasound technology has been used medically since the 1940s. Sonograms, the pictures produced by ultrasound, can reveal heart defects, tumors, and gallstones; since low-power ultrasonic waves don't present any risks to a body, they're most often used to display fetuses during pregnancy in order to make sure they're healthy.

Instead, important people and objects were simply shown larger than less important ones; and although distant objects were sometimes shown smaller than near ones, this wasn't done in a regular and accurate way. Just as odd, many paintings didn't represent the other meaning of perspective either —that is, a scene might not be shown as if it were being seen from one single place. Today, perspective is used much like standpoint. Just as standpoint once used to mean simply the physical place where you stand but today also means the way you “see” things as a result of who you are and what you do, the same could be said about perspective.","root":null},{"spell":"prospectus","explain":"A printed statement that describes something (such as a new business or a stock offering) and is sent out to people who may be interested in buying or investing.","sentence":{"text":"The prospectus for the mutual fund says nothing about how its profit forecasts were calculated.","word":null},"detail":"Like prospect, prospectus looks forward. Thus, a prospectus originally outlined something that didn't yet exist, describing what it would become. This might even be a book; the great dictionary of Noah Webster, like that of Samuel Johnson, was first announced in the form of a prospectus, so that well-to-do people might actually subscribe to it—that is, pay for it in advance so that Webster would have money to live on while writing it. Soon, prospectus was being used to mean a description of a private school or college, intended to attract new students. Today the word very often means a description of a stock offering or mutual fund, whether new or not.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"VOC","description":"VOC comes from the Latin words meaning “voice” and “speak.” So a vocal ensemble is a singing group.

An equivocal answer is one that manages not to take a stand; an unequivocal answer, by contrast, is strong and clear.

Irrevocable trusts are trust funds that cannot be dissolved by the people who created them (the other kind is a revocable trust). An irrevocable credit is an absolute obligation from a bank to provide credit to a customer. Irrevocable gifts, under U.S. tax law, are gifts that are given by one living person to another and can't be reclaimed by the giver.

One emphasizes “whole language” teaching, which relies on teaching a lot of reading; the other emphasizes phonics, teaching how letters and syllables correspond to sounds. Phonics instruction may be especially difficult in English, since English has the most difficult spelling of any Western language. Consider the various ways we create the f sound in cough, photo, and giraffe, or the sh sound in special, issue, vicious, and portion, or the k sound in tack, quite, and shellac, and how we pronounce the o in do, core, lock, and bone, or the ea in lead, ocean, idea, and early.

The Chinese alphabet, however, isn't phonetic, since its symbols represent ideas rather than sounds. But even in English, a letter doesn't always represent the same sound; the “a” in cat, father, and mate, for example, represents three different sounds. Because of this, books about words often use specially created phonetic alphabets in which each symbol stands for a single sound in order to represent pronunciations.

Polyphony reached its height during the 16th century with Italian madrigals and the sacred music of such composers as Tallis, Palestrina, and Byrd. Usually when we speak of polyphony we're talking about music of Bach's time and earlier; but the principles remain the same today, and songwriters such as the Beatles have sometimes used polyphony as well.","root":null},{"spell":"cacophony","explain":"Harsh or unpleasant sound.","sentence":{"text":"In New York she was often dragged off by her boyfriend to downtown jazz concerts, where she struggled to make sense of what sounded like nothing but cacophony.","word":null},"detail":"Cacophony employs the Greek prefix caco-, meaning “bad,” but not everything we call cacophonous is necessarily bad. Grunge, thrash, hardcore, and goth music are unlistenable to some people and very popular to others. Open-air food markets may be marked by a cacophony of voices but also by wonderful sights and sounds.

Folklore has led to some “new” cures of old diseases, and natural substances never before tried have often proved effective. Quinine, which comes from a tree in the Andes, was the original drug for malaria; aspirin's main ingredient came from willow bark; and Taxol, a drug used in treating several cancers, was originally extracted from the bark of a yew tree.

The positions occupied by British royalty are called sinecures by some people, who claim they enjoy their enormous wealth in return for nothing at all.

In geometry, you may be asked to calculate the perimeter of various geometrical shapes.

When you don't floss regularly to keep plaque from forming on your teeth and gums, the gums will slowly deteriorate. Dentists called periodontists specialize in the treatment of periodontal problems, and when the gums have broken down to the point where they can't hold the teeth in place a periodontist may need to provide dental implants, a costly and unpleasant process.

The Lyceum may have resembled the Parthenon in being surrounded by a row of columns, or colonnade, which the Greeks would have called a peripatoi. Aristotle was also said to have paced slowly while teaching, and the Greek word for “pacing” was peripatos. And finally, peripatos meant simply “discussion.” Whatever the source of the word, Aristotle and his followers became known as the Peripatetics, and the “pacing” sense led to peripatetic's English meaning of traveling or moving about. Johnny Appleseed is a good example of a peripatetic soul, and peripatetic executives and salespeople today stare into their laptop computers while endlessly flying from city to city.","root":null},{"spell":"peripheral","explain":"(1) Having to do with the outer edges, especially of the field of vision.

It can be very valuable when, for instance, you're driving into Chicago at rush hour, especially when switching lanes. When people call an issue in a discussion peripheral, they mean that it's not of primary importance, and they're probably suggesting that everyone get back to the main topic.

Radar guns bounce microwaves off moving cars. A burglar alarm may use a photosensor to detect when a beam of light has been broken, or may use ultrasonic sound waves that bounce off moving objects. Still other sensors may detect pressure (barometers) or chemicals (Breathalyzers and smoke detectors). Stud finders, used by carpenters to locate wooden studs under a wall, may employ magnets or radar.

Basic training in the armed forces tries to desensitize new recruits to pain. We can desensitize ourselves to the summer heat by turning off the air conditioning, or become desensitized to the cold by walking barefoot in the snow. But desensitize is more often used when talking about negative emotions. Parents worry that their children will be desensitized to violence by playing video games.

According to polls, about 40% of Americans believe in ESP, and many of them have had personal experiences that seem to prove its existence. When someone jumps into your mind months or years after you had last thought of him or her, and the next day you learn that the person has just died, it can be hard to convince yourself it was just coincidence.

Sensuous usually implies pleasing of the senses by art or similar means; great music, for example, can be a source of sensuous delight. Sensual, on the other hand, usually describes gratification of the senses or physical appetites as an end in itself; thus we often think (perhaps unfairly) of wealthy Romans leading lives devoted to sensual pleasure.

The Sophists originally represented a respectable school of philosophy, but some critics claimed that they tried to persuade by means of clever but misleading arguments.

Cambridge University introduced the term sophomore for its second-year students in the 17th century (though it's no longer used in Britain), maybe to suggest that a sophomore has delusions of wisdom since he's no longer an ignorant freshman.

But since she held him by one heel, this spot did not touch the water and so remained mortal and vulnerable, and it was here that Achilles was eventually mortally wounded. Today, the tendon that stretches up the calf from the heel is called the Achilles tendon. But the term Achilles' heel isn't used in medicine; instead, it's only used with the general meaning “weak point”—for instance, to refer to a section of a country's borders that aren't militarily protected, or to a Jeopardy contestant's ignorance in the Sports category.","root":null},{"spell":"arcadia","explain":"A region or setting of rural pleasure and peacefulness.","sentence":{"text":"The Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania are a vacationer's arcadia.","word":null},"detail":"Arcadia, a beautiful rural area in Greece, became the favorite setting for poems about ideal innocence unaffected by the passions of the larger world, beginning with the works of the Roman poet Virgil.

The “behave” sense of the word comes through French, and its essential meaning is how a person “carries” him- or herself.

But a pendant may also hold a picture or a lock of hair of a lover or a child. And, perhaps because they hang protectively in front of the body and near the heart, pendants have often had symbolic and magical purposes. Thus, a pendant may be a charm or amulet, or its gems or metals may be felt to have health-giving properties.

Lawyers, for example, often speak of appending items to other documents, and lawmakers frequently append small bills to big ones, hoping that everyone will be paying attention only to the main part of the big bill and won't notice. When we append a small separate section to the end of a report or a book, we call it an appendix.

Unlike appendix, appendage doesn't suggest the end of something, but simply something attached. The word is often used in biology to refer to parts of an animal's body: an insect's antennae, mouthparts, or wings, for example. The appendages of some animals will grow back after they've been removed; a salamander, for example, can regrow a finger, and the tiny sea squirt can regrow all its appendages—and even its brain.","root":null},{"spell":"suspend","explain":"(1) To stop something, or to force someone to give up some right or position, for a limited time.

Suspense is a state of uncertainty and maybe anxiety. When we watch a play or movie, we enjoy experiencing a “suspension of disbelief”; that is, we allow ourselves to believe we're watching reality, even though we aren't truly fooled.Suspension can also mean physical hanging; thus, in a suspension bridge, the roadway actually hangs from huge cables.

But extradition may become more complicated when two countries are involved, even though most countries have signed treaties stating that they will send criminals to the country where they are wanted. Many countries often won't send their own citizens to another country for trial; countries that don't permit the death penalty may not agree to send a suspect back to face such a penalty; and most countries won't extradite someone accused of political crimes.

The word was coined by the eminent psychologist C. G. Jung in the early 20th century. The opposite personality type, in Jung's view, was the introvert. Extroverts seem to be favored by societies such as ours, even though introverts seem to be on average more mentally gifted.

The discovery of the photoelectric effect led to important new theories about matter (and to a Nobel Prize for Albert Einstein). Photoelectric cells, or photocells, are used in burglar-alarm light detectors and garage-door openers (both employ a beam of light that is broken when something moves across it), and also to play soundtracks on movie film (where a light beam shines through the soundtrack encoded on the film and is “read” by the photocells).","root":null},{"spell":"photovoltaic","explain":"Involving the direct generation of electricity when sunlight or other radiant energy falls on the boundary between dissimilar substances (such as two different semiconductors).","sentence":{"text":"Photovoltaic technology is being applied to thin film that can produce as much energy as solar cells while using far less semiconducting material.","word":null},"detail":"The -voltaic part of photovoltaic comes from the name of Alessandro Volta, inventor of the electric battery.

The energies of photons range from high-energy gamma rays and X-rays down to low-energy infrared and radio waves, though all travel at the same speed.

Financial officers and tax lawyers can choose how to legally amortize various types of business expenses, some of which may seem much better than others.

Those who have been bedridden for a period of time will notice that their muscles have atrophied. And muscular atrophy is a frequent result of such diseases as cancer and AIDS. We also use atrophy in a much more general sense.

Water molecules tend to cohere, so water falls from the sky in drops, not as separate molecules. But water molecules also adhere to molecules of other substances, so raindrops will often cling to the underside of a clothesline for a while before gravity pulls them down.","root":null},{"spell":"incoherent","explain":"(1) Unclear or difficult to understand. (2) Loosely organized or inconsistent.","sentence":{"text":"The police had found him in an abandoned warehouse, and they reported that he was dirty, hungry, and incoherent.","word":null},"detail":"Incoherent is the opposite of coherent, and both commonly refer to words and thoughts. Just as coherent means well ordered and clear, incoherent means disordered and hard to follow. Incoherence in speech may result from emotional stress, especially anxiety or anger.

A centrifuge is a machine that uses centrifugal force. At the end of a washing machine's cycle, it becomes a weak and simple centrifuge as it whirls the water out of your clothes. Centrifuges hundreds of thousands of times as powerful are essential to nuclear technology and drug manufacturing.

Each part, after it has stated the theme or melody, apparently flees from the next part, which takes up the same theme and sets off in pursuit.

The life of spies consists of an endless series of subterfuges. In the more everyday world, putting words like “heart-healthy” on junk-food packaging is a subterfuge to trick unwary shoppers.

For a five- syllable word, unconscionable is actually quite common. This is partly because it isn't always used very seriously; so, for example, a critic is free to call a fat new book “an unconscionable waste of trees.” In law, an unconscionable contract is one that, even though it was signed by both parties, is so ridiculous that a judge will just throw it out.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"JUNCT","description":"JUNCT comes from the Latin verb jungere, meaning “to join.” A junction is a place where roads or railways come together.

But it more often means something nonphysical. This may be a moment in time, especially a moment when important events are “crossing” (“At this critical juncture, the President called together his top security advisers”).

The participles are words that “take part” in two different word classes: that is, verb forms that can also act like adjectives (“the spoken word,” “a moving experience”).

But when impel takes its noun and adjective forms, it changes slightly. So an impulse—such as “impulse buying,” when you suddenly see something cool and know you've got to have it—often isn't based on anything very serious.

Calliope was the Muse of heroic or epic poetry, who inspired poets to write such epics as the Iliad and the Odyssey. Since the lengthy epics were generally sung from beginning to end, she was responsible for a great deal of musical reciting. But she wouldn't necessarily have approved of having her name used for the hooting organlike instrument that was invented in America around 1855.

To do anything serious in the field of health, you've obviously got to know how the body's organs and cells function normally. Physiology used to be considered separately from anatomy, which focuses on the body's structures; however, it's now known that structure and function can't easily be separated in a scientific way, so “anatomy and physiology” are often spoken of in the same breath.","root":null},{"spell":"methodology","explain":"A set of methods or rules followed in a science or field.","sentence":{"text":"Some researchers claimed that Dr. Keller's methodology was sloppy and had led to unreliable conclusions.","word":null},"detail":"The methodology employed in an experiment is essential to its success, and bad methodology has spoiled thousands of research projects.

In Shakespeare's day, an English theater's parterre was the cheap standing-room area right in front of the stage, normally filled with rowdy spectators. The original idea of the French parterre garden, with its carefully designed plots and walkways, was to present an artistic pattern when seen from above—from a balcony, a raised terrace, or the top of an outdoor staircase.

Mercury, Venus, and Mars are often called the terrestrial planets, since they are rocky balls somewhat like Earth rather than great globes of gas like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Something extraterrestrial comes from beyond the earth and its atmosphere; the word can be used to describe anything “out of this world,” from moon rocks to meteors. Turning to the second sense of terrestrial, animals are often divided into the terrestrial (land-living) and the aquatic (water-living). And sometimes terrestrial animals are contrasted with arboreal animals, those that live in trees.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"MAR","description":"MAR from the Latin word mare, meaning “sea,” brings its salty tang to several English words.

According to Aristotle, the persuasive power of public speaking relies on three elements: the speaker's authority, the logic of the speech, and the speech's pathos. Aristotle claims that pathos is the appeal to the audience's sense of right and wrong, and that it is this (unlike authority and logic) that moves the audience's emotions. Today we usually speak of pathos as an element in fiction, film, drama, music, or even painting, or the real-life pathos of a situation or personality.

We feel little sympathy for him, and may even feel antipathy, or dislike. The American voter is often called apathetic; of all the industrial democracies, only in America does half the adult population fail to vote in major elections.

Today, when reading a novel such as A Tale of Two Cities, only the most hard-hearted reader could fail to feel empathy for Sidney Carton as he approaches the guillotine. One who empathizes suffers along with the one who feels the sensations directly. Empathy is similar to sympathy, but empathy usually suggests stronger, more instinctive feeling. So a person who feels sympathy, or pity, for victims of a war in Asia may feel empathy for a close friend going through the much smaller disaster of a divorce.","root":null},{"spell":"telepathic","explain":"Involving apparent communication from one mind to another without speech or signs.","sentence":{"text":"After ten years of marriage, their communication is virtually telepathic, and each always seems to know what the other is thinking.","word":null},"detail":"Since tele- means “distant” (see TELE), you can see how telepathy means basically “feeling communicated from a distance.” The word was coined around 1880, when odd psychic phenomena were being widely discussed by people hoping that researchers might find a scientific basis for what they believed they themselves were experiencing. Today, when people talk about extrasensory perception, or ESP, telepathy is usually what they're talking about. In recent years, the notion of memes—ideas that might somehow physically fly from brain to brain so that people all over the world might have the same idea at about the same time without any obvious communication— has been widely discussed.

If you happen to prefer Greek, use the synonym polyglot, in which poly- has the same meaning as multi-, and -glot means the same thing as -lingual. The best way to become multilingual is probably to be born in a bilingual (two-language) household; learning those first two seems to give the mind the kind of exercise that makes later language-learning easy.","root":null},{"spell":"lingua","explain":"franca A language used as a common or commercial language among peoples who speak different languages.","sentence":{"text":"That first evening in Tokyo, she heard English being spoken at the next table, and realized it was serving as a lingua franca for a party of Korean and Japanese businessmen.","word":null},"detail":"In the Middle Ages, the Arabs of the eastern Mediterranean referred to all Europeans as Franks (the name of the tribe that once occupied the land we call France). Since there was plenty of Arab-European trade, the traders in the Mediterranean ports eventually developed a trading language combining Italian, Arabic, and other languages, which almost everyone could more or less understand, and it became known as the “Frankish language,” or lingua franca. Some languages actually succeed in becoming lingua francas without changing much. So, when the Roman empire became vast and mighty, Latin became the important lingua franca; and at a meeting between Japanese and Vietnamese businesspeople today, English may well be the only language spoken.","root":null},{"spell":"linguine","explain":"A narrow, flat pasta.","sentence":{"text":"As a test of her clients' table manners, she would serve them challenging dishes and watch to see how gracefully they could handle chopsticks or deal with long, slithery linguine.","word":null},"detail":"The modern language closest to Latin is Italian, and the Italian word linguine means literally “little tongues.” Linguine is only one of the types of pasta whose names describes their shapes. Others include spaghetti (“little strings”), fettuccine (“little ribbons”), penne (“little quills”), orzo (“barley”), farfalle (“butterflies”), vermicelli (“little worms”), capellini (“little hairs”), fusilli (“little spindles”), and radiatori (“little radiators”). If you're thinking about learning Italian, you could make a good start by just visiting an Italian restaurant.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"SPIR","description":"SPIR comes from the Latin words meaning “breath” and “breathe.” When we inspire others—that is, give them inspiration—it's as though we're breathing new energy and imagination into them. When you expire, or die, you “breathe out” your soul in your last breath. A license, membership, credit card, or free offer may also expire, at a time indicated by its expiration date.","words":[{"spell":"spirited","explain":"Full of energy or courage; very lively or determined.","sentence":{"text":"The team put up a spirited defense, but they were doomed from the start.","word":null},"detail":"You may see spirited used to describe a conversation, a debate, a horse, or a campaign.

Maybe for that reason, dispiriting has lots of synonyms: discouraging, disheartening, demoralizing, depressing, etc.","root":null},{"spell":"respirator","explain":"(1) A device worn over the nose and mouth to filter out dangerous substances from the air. (2) A device for maintaining artificial respiration.","sentence":{"text":"His lungs had been terribly damaged by decades of heavy smoking, and he'd been living on a respirator for the last year.","word":null},"detail":"Respiration means simply “breathing.” We usually come across the word in artificial respiration, the lifesaving technique in which you force air into the lungs of someone who's stopped breathing. Respirators can take several different forms. Scuba-diving equipment always includes a respirator, though it doesn't actually do the breathing for the diver. Medical respirators, which are used especially for babies and for emergency care and actually take over the job of getting oxygen into the lungs, are today usually called ventilators, so as to distinguish them from simple oxygen systems (which merely provide a steady flow of oxygen into the nostrils) and face masks.","root":null},{"spell":"transpire","explain":"(1) To happen. (2) To become known.","sentence":{"text":"We kept up our questioning, and it soon transpired that the boys had known about the murder all along .","word":null},"detail":"Since the prefix trans- means “through” (see TRANS), transpire's most literal meaning is something like “breathe through.” Thus, the original meaning of the English word—still used today—is to give off a watery vapor through a surface such as a leaf. From there, it came to mean also the gradual appearance of previously secret information, as if leaking out of the pores of a leaf (as in “It transpired that she was not only his employee but also his girlfriend”). And soon it was being used to mean simply “happen” (as in “I wondered what had transpired in the cafeteria at lunchtime”).","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"VER","description":"VER comes from the Latin word for “truth.” A verdict in a trial is “the truth spoken” (see DICT).

Since neither side wanted the other to know its secrets, verification of the facts became a difficult issue. Because of the distrust on both sides, many doubted that the real numbers would ever be verifiable.","root":null},{"spell":"aver","explain":"To state positively as true; declare.","sentence":{"text":"The defendant averred that she was nowhere near the scene of the crime on the night in question.","word":null},"detail":"Since aver contains the “truth” root, it basically means “confirm as true.” You may aver anything that you're sure of. In legal situations, aver means to state positively as a fact; thus, Perry Mason's clients aver that they are innocent, while the district attorney avers the opposite. If you make such a statement while under oath, and it turns out that you lied, you may have committed the crime of perjury.","root":null},{"spell":"verisimilitude","explain":"(1) The appearance of being true or probable. (2) The depiction of realism in art or literature.","sentence":{"text":"By the beginning of the 20th century, the leading European painters were losing interest in verisimilitude and beginning to experiment with abstraction.","word":null},"detail":"From its roots, verisimilitude means basically “similarity to the truth.” Most fiction writers and filmmakers aim at some kind of verisimilitude to give their stories an air of reality. They need not show something actually true, or even very common, but simply something believable. A mass of good details in a play, novel, painting, or film may add verisimilitude. A spy novel without some verisimilitude won't interest many readers, but a fantastical novel may not even attempt to seem true to life.","root":null},{"spell":"veracity","explain":"(1) Truth or accuracy. (2) The quality of being truthful or honest.","sentence":{"text":"We haven't been able to check the veracity of most of his story, but we know he wasn't at the motel that night.","word":null},"detail":"People often claim that a frog placed in cold water that then is gradually heated will let itself be boiled to death, but the story actually lacks veracity. We often hear that the Eskimo (Inuit) peoples have dozens of words for “snow,” but the veracity of the statement is doubtful, since Eskimo languages seem to have no more snow words than English (with flake, blizzard, powder, drift, freezing rain, etc.). In 2009 millions accepted the veracity of the claim that, against all the evidence, the elected president wasn't a native-born American. Not all the “facts” we accept without thinking are harmless.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"TURB","description":"TURB comes from the Latin verb turbare, “to throw into confusion or upset,” and the noun turba, “crowd” or “confusion.” So a disturbance, for example, confuses and upsets normal order or routine.","words":[{"spell":"turbid","explain":"(1) Thick or murky, especially with churned-up sediment.

A chemical solution may be described as turbid rather than clear. And your emotions may be turbid as well, especially where love is involved: What did he mean by that glance? Why did she say it like that?","root":null},{"spell":"perturb","explain":"To upset, confuse, or disarrange.","sentence":{"text":"News of the new peace accord was enough to perturb some radical opponents of any settlements.","word":null},"detail":"With its per- prefix, perturb meant originally “thoroughly upset,” though today the word has lost most of its intense edge. Perturb and perturbation are often used by scientists, usually when speaking of a change in their data indicating that something has affected some normal process. When someone is referred to as imperturbable, it means he or she manages to remain calm through the most trying experiences.","root":null},{"spell":"turbine","explain":"A rotary engine with blades made to turn and generate power by a current of water, steam, or air under pressure.","sentence":{"text":"The power plant used huge turbines powered by water going over the dam to generate electricity.","word":null},"detail":"The oldest and simplest form of turbine is the waterwheel, which is made to rotate by water falling across its blades and into buckets suspended from them. Hero of Alexandria invented the first steam-driven turbine in the 1st century A.D., but a commercially practical steam turbine wasn't developed until 1884; steam turbines are now the main elements of electric power stations. Jet engines are gas turbines. A turbojet engine uses a turbine to compress the incoming air that feeds the engine before being ejected to push the plane forward; a turboprop engine uses its exhaust to drive a turbine that spins a propeller. A wind turbine generates electricity by being turned by the wind; the largest now have vanes with a turning diameter of over 400 feet.","root":null},{"spell":"turbulent","explain":"(1) Stirred up, agitated. (2) Stirring up unrest, violence, or disturbance.","sentence":{"text":"The huge ocean liner Queen Elizabeth II was never much troubled by turbulent seas that might have sunk smaller boats.","word":null},"detail":"Some people lead turbulent lives, and some are constantly in the grip of turbulent emotions. The late 1960s are remembered as turbulent years of social revolution in America and Europe. Often the captain of an airplane will warn passengers to fasten their seatbelts because of upper-air turbulence, which can make for a bumpy ride. El Niño, a seasonal current of warm water in the Pacific Ocean, may create turbulence in the winds across the United States, affecting patterns of rainfall and temperature as well.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"VOLU/VOLV","description":"VOLU/VOLV comes from the Latin verb volvere, meaning “to roll, wind, turn around, or twist around.” Thus, revolve simply means “turn in circles.” And a volume was originally a scroll or roll of papyrus.","words":[{"spell":"voluble","explain":"Speaking readily and rapidly; talkative.","sentence":{"text":"He proved to be a voluble informer who would tell stories of bookies, smugglers, and hit men to the detectives for hours.","word":null},"detail":"A voluble person has words “rolling” off his or her tongue.

(2) To gradually go from an advanced state to a less advanced state.","sentence":{"text":"Since 1998, considerable power has been devolving from the British government in London to the new Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.","word":null},"detail":"With its de- prefix (see DE), devolution implies moving backward. Once powers have been centralized in a unified government, giving any powers back—that is, devolving the power—to a smaller governmental unit can seem to be reversing a natural development. In a somewhat similar way, a job that your boss doesn't want to do may devolve upon you. But devolve and devolution are also treated nowadays as the opposites of evolve and evolution. So we may also speak of moral devolution, such as occurred in Germany in the 1930s, when a country with an extraordinary culture became a brutal dictatorship. And parents may watch their slacker teenager and wonder if devolution is occurring right in front of their eyes.","root":null},{"spell":"evolution","explain":"A process of change from a lower, simpler, or worse state to one that is higher, more complex, or better.","sentence":{"text":"Thomas Jefferson and the other Founding Fathers believed that political evolution reached its highest form in democracy.","word":null},"detail":"Part of the humor of the old Flintstones cartoon show is that it contradicts what is known about biological evolution, since humans actually evolved long after dinosaurs were extinct. Evolution can also be used more broadly to refer to technology, society, and other human creations. For example, an idea may evolve, even in your own mind, as the months or years pass. And though many people don't believe that human beings truly become better with the passing centuries, many will argue that our societies tend to evolve, producing more goods and providing more protection for more people.","root":null},{"spell":"convoluted","explain":"(1) Having a pattern of curved windings. (2) Involved, intricate.","sentence":{"text":"After 10 minutes, Mr. Collins's strange story had become so convoluted that none of us could follow it.","word":null},"detail":"Convolution originally meant a complex winding pattern such as those visible on the surface of the brain. So a convoluted argument or a convoluted explanation is one that winds this way and that. An official document may have to wind its way through a convoluted process and be stamped by eight people before being approved. Convoluted language makes many people suspicious; as a great philosopher once said, “Anything that can be said can be said clearly.”","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"FAC","description":"FAC comes from the Latin verb facere, meaning “to make or do.” Thus, a fact was originally simply “something done.” A benefactor is someone who does good. And to manufacture is to make, usually in a factory.","words":[{"spell":"factor","explain":"Something that contributes to producing a result: ingredient.","sentence":{"text":"The most important factor in the success of the treaty talks was the physical presence of the two presidents.","word":null},"detail":"In Latin factor means simply “doer.” So in English a factor is an “actor” or element or ingredient in some situation or quantity. Charm can be a factor in someone's success, and lack of exercise can be a factor in producing a poor physique. In math we use factor to mean a number that can be multiplied or divided to produce a given number (for example, 5 and 8 are factors of 40). And in biology a gene may be called a factor, since genes are ingredients in the total organism.","root":null},{"spell":"factotum","explain":"A person whose job involves doing many different kinds of work.","sentence":{"text":"Over the years she had become the office factotum, who might be doing legal research one day and organizing the company picnic the next.","word":null},"detail":"This odd word doesn't come from ancient Latin, but it was coined to look as if it did. The term Johannes factotum, meaning “Jack-of-all-trades,” first shows up in writing in 1592 to describe none other than Shakespeare himself. The word gofer is similar to factotum but a bit less dignified. In other words, a factotum is an assistant, but one who may have taken over some fairly important functions.","root":null},{"spell":"facile","explain":"(1) Easily accomplished. (2) Shallow, superficial.","sentence":{"text":"The principal made a facile argument for the school's policy, but no one was convinced.","word":null},"detail":"A facile suggestion doesn't deal with the issue in any depth, and a facile solution may be only temporarily effective.

Clever employees are quietly facilitating all kinds of useful activity within their organizations all the time. People who lead therapy groups or workshops are often called facilitators, since their job isn't to teach or to order but rather to make the meetings as productive as possible. Even businesses now use facilitators in meetings where they don't want any person's particular desires to outweigh anyone else's. The facilitation of a rewarding discussion should be a facilitator's only goal. Today, in recognition of the many different situations that may call for a facilitator, there is even an International Association of Facilitators.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"LUM","description":"LUM comes from the Latin noun lumen, meaning “light.” Thus, our word illuminate means “to supply with light” or “make clear,” and illumination is light that shines on something.","words":[{"spell":"lumen","explain":"In physics, the standard unit for measuring the rate of the flow of light.","sentence":{"text":"The lumen is a measure of the perceived power of light.","word":null},"detail":"There are two common units for measuring light, the candela and the lumen. Both are recognized as standard international units, which also include the second (for time), the kilogram (for weight), and the meter (for length). The candela is a measure of intensity; an ordinary candle gives off light with the intensity of about one candela. The lumen is a measure of “luminous flux”; a standard 100-watt lightbulb gives off 1500–1700 lumens. Luminous flux indicates how much light is actually perceived by the human eye. Technologies vary in how efficiently they turn electricity into light; halogen lights produce about 12 lumens per watt, ordinary incandescent lightbulbs produce about 15 lumens per watt, and compact fluorescent bulbs produce about 50 lumens per watt.","root":null},{"spell":"luminous","explain":"(1) Producing or seeming to produce light.

Luminous signs depend on a gas such as neon, krypton, argon, xenon, or radon—and you can use luminous (DayGlo) paint to make your own signs.

On land, fireflies, glowworms, and the fox-fire fungus are all known for their bioluminescence. In the sea, bioluminescent life-forms include plankton, squid, and comb jellies, as well as some unusual fish. Most deep-sea animals are bioluminescent, but single-celled algae living at or near the surface can also create a remarkable show, as they often do in Bioluminescent Bay on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.

A shrine to the Muses was called in Latin a museum. An artist or poet about to begin work would call on his particular Muse to inspire him, and a poem itself might begin with such a call; thus, Homer's Odyssey begins, “Sing to me of the man, Muse” (that is, of Odysseus).

He beautified the capital, Halicarnassus, with all sorts of fine public buildings, but he is best known for the magnificent monument, the Mausoleum, that was built by his wife Artemisia after his death. With its great height (perhaps 140 feet) and many beautiful sculptures, the Mausoleum was declared one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

During that time, the son he left as a babe in arms grew up under the supervision of Mentor, an old and trusted friend. When the goddess Athena decided it was time to complete young Telemachus's education by sending him off to learn about his father, she visited him disguised as Mentor and they set out together. Today, anyone such as a coach or tutor who gives another (usually younger) person help and advice on how to achieve success in the larger world is called a mentor.

One was the nymph Echo, who could only repeat the last thing that anyone said. When Narcissus cruelly rejected her, she wasted away to nothing but her voice. Though he played with the affections of others, Narcissus became a victim of his own attractiveness. When he caught sight of his own reflection in a pool, he sat gazing at it in fascination, wasting away without food or drink, unable to touch or kiss the image he saw. When he finally died, the gods turned him into the flower we call the narcissus, which stands with its head bent as though gazing at its reflection.

Almost all the gods realized what was happening and refused the meal, though only after Demeter had taken a nibble out of Pelops's shoulder. After they had reconstructed him, replacing the missing shoulder with a piece of ivory, they turned to punishing Tantalus. In Hades he stands in water up to his neck under a tree laden with fruit. Each time he stoops to drink, the water moves out of reach; each time he reaches up to pick something, the branches move beyond his grasp. He is thus eternally tantalized by the water and fruit.

According to tradition, the Greek dramatist Thespis, of the 6th century B.C., was the inventor of tragedy and the first to write roles for the individual actor as distinct from the chorus, and the actor's exchanges with the chorus were the first dramatic dialogue. Since Thespis himself performed the individual parts in his own plays, he was also the first true actor. Ever since choruses disappeared from drama, thespians have filled all the roles in plays.

Penumbra can thus be used to describe any “gray area” where things aren't all black and white. For example, the right to privacy falls under the penumbra of the U.S. Constitution; though it isn't specifically guaranteed there, the Supreme Court has held that it is implied, and thus that the government may not intrude into certain areas of a citizen's private life. Because its existence is still shadowy, however, the Court is still determining how much of an individual's life is protected by the right to privacy.","root":null},{"spell":"umbrage","explain":"A feeling of resentment at some slight or insult, often one that is imagined rather than real.","sentence":{"text":"She often took umbrage at his treatment of her, without being able to pinpoint what was offensive about it.","word":null},"detail":"An umbrage was originally a shadow, and soon the word also began to mean “a shadowy suspicion.” Then it came to mean “displeasure” as well—that is, a kind of shadow blocking the sunlight.

The Middle Ages saw much debate over the investiture of bishops by kings and emperors. These rulers felt that high religious offices were theirs to give as rewards for someone's loyal service or as bribes for someone's future support; the popes, on the other hand, regarded these investitures as the improper buying and selling of church offices. The investiture struggle caused tension between popes and monarchs and even led to wars.","root":null},{"spell":"transvestite","explain":"A person, especially a male, who wears the clothing and adopts the mannerisms of the opposite sex.","sentence":{"text":"In Handel's operas, the heroic male leading roles are today often sung by female transvestites, since he originally wrote them for the soprano range.","word":null},"detail":"Transvestite includes the prefix trans-, “across,” and thus means literally “cross-dresser.” In the theater, from ancient Greece to Elizabethan England, transvestism was common because all parts—even Juliet—were played by men. Traditional Japanese Kabuki and Noh drama still employ transvestism of this sort. In everyday life, it's now so acceptable for women to wear men's clothing that the word transvestite is generally applied only to men. The much newer word transgender describes people who think of themselves as having changed sex, or who simply don't believe in the idea that they're either one sex or the other.","root":null},{"spell":"travesty","explain":"(1) An inferior or distorted imitation.

Since cross-dressing often isn't very convincing, the word has usually referred to something absurd. So a verdict that angers people may be denounced as a “travesty of justice.” Saturday Night Live specializes in dramatic travesties mocking everything from political figures and issues to popular culture —“disguised” versions intended for entertainment.

In Rome, apotheosis was rare until the emperor Augustus declared the dead Julius Caesar to be a god, and soon other dead emperors were being apotheosized as well. In older paintings you may see a heroic figure— Napoleon, George Washington, or Shakespeare, for example—being raised into the clouds, symbolizing his or her apotheosis. But today any great classic example of something can be called its apotheosis. You might hear it said, for example, that Baroque music reached its apotheosis in the works of J. S.

And once the Christian church was firmly established, it condemned the Romans as atheists because they didn't believe in the Christian God. In later centuries, English-speaking Christians would often use the words pagan and heathen to describe such non- Christians, while atheist would be reserved for those who actually denied the existence of any god.

This extraordinary domed structure is still one of the important sights of Rome, and the burial place for the painters Raphael and Carracci and two kings.

But theocracies are rare today. Modern Iran and Saudi Arabia (and perhaps half a dozen others) are usually regarded as theocratic governments, since, even though Iran's president is elected by popular vote and Saudi Arabia is ruled by a royal family, the countries' laws are religious laws.

The Orthodox church favors icons partly because they communicate directly and forcefully even to uneducated people. They are regarded as sacred; some believers actually pray to them, and many believe that icons have carried out miracles. The common modern uses of icon grew out of this original sense. The fact that Orthodox icons have a symbolic role led to icon being used to mean simply “symbol.” Because of the icon's sacredness, the term also came to mean “idol.” And once we began to use idol to refer to pop-culture stars, it wasn't long before we began using icon the same way.

But in the Ten Commandments given to Moses in the Old Testament, God prohibits the making of “graven images” or “idols” for worship, proclaiming that the Jews are to worship only one God, who is too great to be represented in an idol. However, by the 6th century A.D., Christians had begun to create religious images in order to focus the prayers of the faithful. Opposition to icons led to the Iconoclastic Controversy in A.D. 726, when, supported by the pope, iconoclasts began smashing and burning the images in churches and monasteries (clast- comes from the Greek word meaning “to break”). In time, peace was restored, and almost all Christians have since accepted depictions of Jesus, Mary, and the saints. Today an iconoclast is someone who constantly argues with conventional thinking, refusing to “worship” the objects of everyone else's “faith.”","root":null},{"spell":"iconography","explain":"(1) The imagery and symbolism of a work of art or an artist.

And if a painting showed a young woman reclining on a bed with a shower of gold descending on her, would you recognize her as Danaë, locked up in a tower to keep her away from the lustful Zeus, who then managed to gain access to her by transforming himself into golden light (or golden coins)?

(Notice that, for some reason, urbane is almost always used to describe men rather than women.) Teenagers in the 1960s read James Bond novels and watched his character onscreen to get tips about acquiring an urbane identity.

Today the Web makes possible more than anyone could have dreamed of back in the 1950s.

The “doctrines” (ideas) preached by demagogues will naturally always be the kind that appeal directly to the ordinary voter, the “common man” or “little guy.” Appealing to the common people is not itself a bad thing, but it has often been used by those who calculate that demagoguery (or demagogy) is the easiest way to power.

Demotic is still an intellectual word, but it can now be used to describe any popular style in contrast to a style associated with a higher class, especially a style of speech or writing. So, for example, demotic Californian is different from demotic Texan. The most demotic dress today is probably blue jeans and sneakers, and those who wear them have demotic taste in fashion.

It sometimes has a religious tendency; it usually isn't very interested in international affairs; it has sometimes been unfriendly to immigrants and blacks; and it's often anti-intellectual.

By inculpating someone else, an accused person may manage to exculpate himself. Through plea bargaining, the prosecution can often encourage a defendant to inculpate his friends in return for a lighter sentence.","root":null},{"spell":"mea","explain":"culpa An admission of personal fault or error.","sentence":{"text":"The principal said his mea culpa at the school board meeting, but not all the parents were satisfied.","word":null},"detail":"Mea culpa, Latin for “through my fault,” comes from the prayer in the Catholic mass in which, back when Latin was still the language of the mass, one would confess to having sinned “mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa” (“through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault”). When we say “Mea culpa” today, it means “I apologize” or “It was my fault.” But mea culpa is also common as a noun.

But when a crisis arose in the Roman Republic, the senate would appoint a dictator, who would have the power to rule by edict. The idea was that the dictator could make decisions quickly, issuing his edicts faster than the senate could act.

The most important ones include which court will hear a given case and which law- enforcement agency can get involved. But although they may seem like mere technicalities, jurisdictional matters sometimes turn out to be all-important in the final outcome. Jurisdiction may depend on where you are (for example, in which state), on who you are (if you're a juvenile, for example, you may only be tried in juvenile court), and on what the subject is (for example, cases involving the estate left by someone who has died are dealt with in probate court).","root":null},{"spell":"dictum","explain":"A formal and authoritative statement.","sentence":{"text":"It has long been a dictum of American foreign policy that the government doesn't negotiate with kidnappers and terrorists.","word":null},"detail":"The word dictum is frequently used in philosophy, but also in economics, political science, and other fields. Almost any condensed piece of wisdom —”The perfect is the enemy of the good,” “Buy low, sell high,” “All politics is local,” etc.—can be called a dictum. In the law, judges may often add to a written opinion an obiter dictum, or “statement made in passing”—a strong statement that isn't directly relevant to the case being decided.

H. Huxley, who had just spent a decade defending the works of Charles Darwin against the attacks of the church. Scientists often put a high value on evidence when arguing about religion, and many agnostic thinkers believe that human minds simply aren't equipped to grasp the nature of God. But agnostics differ from atheists, who actually claim that no God exists and may even think they can prove it. You may have seen the similar word gnostic, the name for followers of certain religious sects from around the time of Christ that sought spiritual knowledge and rejected the material world. An increasing interest in gnosticism today can be seen in the popular novels of Philip Pullman, Dan Brown, and Neil Gaiman.","root":null},{"spell":"incognito","explain":"In disguise, or with one's identity concealed.","sentence":{"text":"Years after her reign as a top Hollywood star, she was discovered working incognito as a bartender in Manhattan while living in cheap hotels.","word":null},"detail":"In a famous myth, Zeus and Hermes visit a village incognito to test the villagers.

(2) A forecast or prophecy.","sentence":{"text":"The prognosis for a patient with chicken pox is usually excellent; the prognosis for someone with liver cancer is terrible.","word":null},"detail":"With its prefix pro-, meaning “before,” prognosis means basically “knowledge beforehand” of how a situation is likely to turn out. Prognosis was originally a strictly medical term, but it soon broadened to include predictions made by experts of all kinds. Thus, for example, economists are constantly offering prognoses (notice the irregular plural form) about where the economy is going, and climate scientists regularly prognosticate about how quickly the earth's atmosphere is warming.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"GRAPH","description":"GRAPH comes from the Greek verb graphein, “to write.” Thus, a biography is a written account of someone's life (see BIO), a discography is a written list of recordings on disc (records or CDs), and a filmography is a list of motion pictures.

Calligraphy has existed in many cultures, including Indian, Persian, and Islamic cultures; Arabic puts a particularly high value on beautiful script, and in East Asia calligraphy has long been considered a major art.

These often included terrifically colorful stories (about slaying dragons, magically traveling through space, etc.) that were perhaps a bit too good to be strictly true, and after finding God not one of them ever did a single thing that wasn't saintly—and some of them may not have actually existed.

But the actual notating of dances by means of symbols didn't begin until the 17th or 18th century, when ballet developed into a complex art form in France.

The lithographic process was invented around 1796 and soon became the main method of printing books and newspapers. Artists use lithography to produce prints (works intended to be sold in many copies), and art lithographs sometimes resemble older types of prints, including etchings, engravings, and woodcuts. Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Joan Miró, and M. C. Escher are among the many artists who have used lithography to produce important original works. Today lithographic printing accounts for over 40% of all printing, packaging, and publishing.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"ART","description":"ART comes from the Latin word for “skill.” This reminds us that, until a few centuries ago, almost no one made a strong distinction between skilled craftsmanship and what we would now call “art.” And the word art itself could also mean simply “cleverness.” The result is that this root appears in some words where we might not expect it.","words":[{"spell":"artful","explain":"(1) Skillful.

The same writer might also make an artful argument, one that cleverly leaves out certain details and plays up others so as to make a stronger case.

The roots of artifact mean basically “something made with skill”; thus, a mere stone that was used for pounding isn't an artifact, since it wasn't shaped by humans for its purpose—unlike a ram's horn that was polished and given a brass mouthpiece and was blown as part of a religious ritual.","root":null},{"spell":"artifice","explain":"(1) Clever skill. (2) A clever trick.","sentence":{"text":"By his cunning and artifice, Iago convinces Othello that Desdemona has been unfaithful.","word":null},"detail":"Artifice can be a tricky word to use. It combines the same roots as artifact, so it's sometimes seen in descriptions of craftsmanship (“The artifice that went into this jewelry can still astound us,” “The chef had used all his artifice to disguise the nature of the meat”). But it can also be used for many situations that don't involve physical materials (“They had gotten around the rules by a clever artifice,” “The artifice of the plot is ingenious”). Like its adjective, artificial, artifice isn't necessarily either positive nor negative.

In the Middle Ages, artisans organized themselves into guilds. In every city each group of artisans—weavers, carpenters, shoemakers, and so on—had its own guild, which set wages and prices, kept standards high, and protected its members from outside competitors. In America, however, most artisans have always been fiercely independent. Today, when factories produce almost all of our goods, artisans usually make only fine objects for those who can afford them. And we now even include food among the artisan's crafts, so you can buy artisanal cheeses, breads, and chocolates—but probably not if you're watching your budget.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"FORT","description":"FORT comes from fortis, Latin for “strong.” The familiar noun fort, meaning a building strengthened against possible attacks, comes directly from it.

A water-filled ditch, or moat, might run alongside the wall for added defense. Such defenses turned the entire city into a fort, or fortress. Over the centuries, fortifications changed steadily with the development of new weaponry.

In Latin, the quality of fortitudo combines physical strength, vigor, courage, and boldness, but the English fortitude usually means simply firmness and steadiness of will, or “backbone.” The philosopher Plato long ago listed four essential human virtues—prudence (i.e., good judgment), justice (i.e., ability to be fair in balancing between one's own interests and others'), temperance (i.e., moderation or restraint), and fortitude, and in Christian tradition these became known as the four “cardinal virtues.”","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"CIS","description":"CIS comes from the Latin verb meaning “to cut, cut down, or slay.” An incisor is one of the big front biting teeth; beavers and woodchucks have especially large ones.

A surgeon may excise a large cancerous tumor, or make a tiny excision to examine an organ's tissue. Excise is also a noun, meaning a tax paid on something manufactured and sold in the U.S. Much of what consumers pay for tobacco or alcohol products go to cover the excise taxes that the state and federal government charge the manufacturers.

An apiary usually consists of many separate beehives. The social life of a hive is strange and marvelous. The queen bee, who will become the mother of an entire colony, is actually created by being fed “royal jelly” while she is still only a larva. The tens of thousands of worker bees are underdeveloped females; only a handful of the bees are male, and they do no work at all.

Stories of children raised by wolves (the most famous being Romulus, the legendary founder of Rome) have generally been hard to prove, partly because “wild” children lack human language abilities and can't describe their experiences.

Theories are often abstractions; so a theory about economics, for instance, may “pull back” to take a broad view that somehow explains all of economics (but maybe doesn't end up explaining any of it very successfully).

The heliotrope tends to follow the sun— that is, turn its blossoms toward the sun as it travels from East to West every day. But the fact is, heliotropism—turning toward the sun—is common among flowers (and even leaves), and some, like the sunflower, are more dramatically heliotropic than the heliotrope.

Native American religions, for example, have used psychotropic substances derived from certain cactuses and mushrooms for centuries. Caffeine and nicotine can be called psychotropic. Psychotropic prescription drugs include antidepressants (such as Prozac) and tranquilizers (such as Valium). Any medication that blocks pain, from aspirin to the anesthetics used during surgery, can be considered a psychotropic drug.

So after the showy style of Europe's so-called baroque era (from about 1600 to the early 1700s), the reaction came in the form of the neoclassical movement, bringing order, restraint, and simpler and more conservative structures, whether in plays, sonatas, sculptures, or public buildings. Its inspiration was the art of ancient Greece and Rome—that is, of classical antiquity. Why classical? In Latin classicus meant “of the highest class,” so in English classic and classical originally described the best ancient Greek and Latin literature, but soon came to mean simply “of ancient Greek and Rome,” since these were already seen as the highest and best cultures. Neoclassic generally describes artworks from the 1700s or early 1800s (by the painter David, the composer Mozart, the sculptor Canova, etc.), but also works from the 20th century that seem to have been inspired by the ideals of Greece and Rome.","root":null},{"spell":"Neolithic","explain":"Of or relating to the latest period of the Stone Age, when polished stone tools were used.","sentence":{"text":"Around the Mediterranean, the Neolithic period was a time of trade, of stock breeding, and of the first use of pottery.","word":null},"detail":"Since lithos in Greek means “stone,” the Neolithic period is the “new” or “late” period of the Stone Age, in contrast to the Paleolithic period (“old” or “early” period—see PALEO) and the Mesolithic period (“middle” period) of the Stone Age. The use of polished stone tools came to different parts of the world at different times, but the Neolithic Age is usually said to begin around 9000 B.C. and to end around 3000 B.C., when the Bronze Age begins.

Rather than simply drifting toward the political center, Podhoretz and Kristol actually moved far to the right, especially on the issue of maintaining a strong military stance toward the rest of the world. The main magazine of neoconservatism became Podhoretz's Commentary; it was later joined by the Weekly Standard, edited by Kristol's son William.

In its second sense, the animal characters in Aesop's fables are anthropomorphic since they all have human feelings and thoughts even though they don't look like humans. Thus, when the fox calls the grapes sour simply because they're out of reach, it's a very human response.

The total domination of Europe, for example, has never been achieved: The Roman empire could never fully dominate the northern Germanic tribes; Napoleon couldn't conquer Spain; and although Adolf Hitler was briefly dominant over most of the continent, he never managed to overpower England. But the word's earliest appearances don't necessarily involve physical force; Chaucer, for instance, speaks of a mind's domination by strong drink.

Holism generally opposes the Western tendency toward analysis, the breaking down of wholes into parts sometimes to the point that “you can't see the forest for the trees.” Holism is an important concept in the sciences and social sciences, and especially in medicine.

Well, in geological language, the Holocene epoch follows the Paleocene (“remotely recent”), the Eocene (“early recent”), the Oligocene (“scarcely recent”), the Miocene (“less recent”), the Pliocene (“more recent”), and the Pleistocene (“most recent”) epochs—so the Holocene is the “wholly recent” period of geological time.","root":null},{"spell":"holocaust","explain":"(1) (usually capitalized) The mass slaughter of European civilians and especially Jews by the Nazis during World War II.

The word is used about 200 times in the traditional Greek version of the Old Testament, though it rarely appears in English translations. In the 1700s holocaust began to be used to refer to the mass destruction of life. But no mass murder in Western history ever approached the scale achieved by the Nazis.

Retrogression is usually an undesirable decline from a higher or advanced level. So, for instance, in difficult social situations an adolescent can retrogress to a childish level of maturity. And under the extreme conditions of total war, a whole society may retrogress to a primitive state. The increasing number of poor or homeless people has been seen as evidence of modern social retrogression, and the rise of loud, name-calling TV and radio personalities strikes many people as a sign of political retrogression.","root":null},{"spell":"retrospective","explain":"A generally comprehensive exhibition or performance usually covering an artist's output to date.","sentence":{"text":"A retrospective covering the photographer's entire career is forcing critics to revise their earlier estimates of her status as an artist.","word":null},"detail":"Retrospective is partly rooted in the Latin verb specere, “to look,” so a retrospective is a look back at an artist's career. The subject of a retrospective is usually an older living artist, or one who has recently died. Galleries and museums honor painters and sculptors, film festivals honor directors and actors, and concert organizations honor composers.

The American system of government features a separation of church and state—that is, a separation of spiritual and temporal authority. But such separation is relatively recent. In past centuries, the Roman Catholic Church exerted temporal authority—that is, political power —throughout much of Europe, and the Church of England has always been officially headed by the temporal ruler of Great Britain. Temporal isn't always used in religious contexts; for example, child psychologists often measure “temporal processing”—that is, speed of thinking—in children with mental difficulties. Note that temporal may also mean “near the temples (of the head)”; thus, your brain's temporal lobes are situated at your temples.

(2) Having to do with the present period; modern or current.","sentence":{"text":"The two scientists were contemporary with each other, but neither seemed to have heard of the other's existence.","word":null},"detail":"Contemporary can be confusing because of its slightly different meanings. In everyday use, it generally means simply “modern” or “new.” But before the 20th century it instead referred only to things from the same era as certain other things; so, for instance, Jesus was contemporary with the Roman emperors Augustus and Tiberius, and Muhammad was contemporary with Pope Gregory the Great.

People aren't usually admired for temporizing. A political leader faced with a difficult issue may temporize by talking vaguely about possible solutions without actually doing anything.

Today, a writer may spend months doing research in order to avoid anachronisms in the historical novel she's working on.

This type of synchronized movement is important, since you have to know where to aim your satellite dish. In the computer field, synchronous usually refers to the use of a simple timing signal that permits very rapid exchange of data between computers. The kind of mysterious coincidence sometimes called synchronicity—such as the appearance of two different comic-strip characters named Dennis the Menace in the U.S. and Britain within three days of each other in 1951—has fascinated people for centuries.","root":null}]}],"specialSection":[{"spell":"triad","explain":"(1) A group of three usually related people or things. (2) A secret Chinese criminal organization.","sentence":{"text":"The kids in the garage band next door seemed to know six or seven triads and a couple of seventh chords.","word":null},"detail":"The best-known type of triad is a type of musical chord consisting of three notes. A D-major triad is made up of the notes D, F-sharp, and A; an F-minor triad is made up of F, A-flat, and C; and so on. Major and minor triads form the basis of tonal music, and songs and other pieces usually end with a triadic harmony. In medicine, a triad is a set of three symptoms that go together. The Chinese criminal organizations called triads got their name from the triangular symbol that they used back when they began, centuries ago, as patriotic organizations. Today, with over 100,000 members, the triads operate in the U.S., Canada, and many other countries.","root":null},{"spell":"trilogy","explain":"A series of three creative works that are closely related and develop a single theme.","sentence":{"text":"William Faulkner's famous “Snopes trilogy” consists of the novels The Hamlet, The Town, and The Mansion.","word":null},"detail":"Dozens of tragic trilogies were written for the Greek stage, though only one, Aeschylus's great Oresteia (consisting of Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides), has survived complete. Authors in later years have occasionally chosen to create trilogies to allow themselves to develop a highly complex story or cover a long span of time. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings wasn't actually intended as a trilogy, but since it was published in three volumes it's usually called one. George Lucas's three original Star Wars movies are an example of a film trilogy (which he followed many years later by another).","root":null},{"spell":"triceratops","explain":"One of a group of large dinosaurs that lived during the Cretaceous period and had three horns, a bony crest or hood, and hoofed toes.","sentence":{"text":"The triceratops probably used its three horns for defense against the attacks of meat-eating dinosaurs.","word":null},"detail":"The name triceratops, meaning literally “three-horned face,” refers to the two horns above its eyes and the smaller third horn on its snout. Just as striking was the frilled hood or ruff that rose behind its head, though no one is quite sure what it was for. The triceratops was one of the last dinosaurs to evolve and also one of the last to become extinct. It could reach lengths of 30 feet and could stand nearly eight feet high. Despite its ferocious looks and three- foot-long horns, the triceratops was actually a vegetarian.","root":null},{"spell":"trident","explain":"A three-pronged spear, especially one carried by various sea gods in classical mythology.","sentence":{"text":"The bronze statue at the middle of the great fountain depicted a sea god emerging from the water, wreathed in seaweed and carrying a large trident.","word":null},"detail":"A trident has three prongs or teeth, as the root dent, “tooth,” tells us. The trident has long been used to spear fish in different parts of the world, so there's no mystery about why the Greek sea god Poseidon and his Roman counterpart Neptune both carry a trident as their symbol. In some gladiator exhibitions in ancient Rome, one gladiator, called a retiarius (“net man”), would be equipped as though he were a fisherman, with a weighted net and a trident; with his net he would snare his sword-wielding opponent, and with his trident he would spear his helpless foe.","root":null},{"spell":"trimester","explain":"(1) A period of about three months, especially one of three such periods in a human pregnancy. (2) One of three terms into which an academic year is sometimes divided.","sentence":{"text":"Most women experience morning sickness in the first trimester of pregnancy.","word":null},"detail":"Semester, which comes from the Latin words for “six” and “month,” has come to mean half an academic year when the year is divided into two segments. When an academic year is divided into three segments, each is called a trimester (which is usually a bit more accurate, since each segment often is close to three months in length). Some colleges operate on the “quarter” system, with the summer being the fourth quarter, but this just means that each quarter is basically a trimester. In a human pregnancy, a trimester is three months long, representing one-third of the nine months that a typical pregnancy lasts.","root":null},{"spell":"trinity","explain":"(1) (capitalized) The unity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three persons in one God in Christian belief. (2) A group of three people.","sentence":{"text":"In Christian art depicting the Trinity, the Holy Spirit is almost always shown as a radiant dove.","word":null},"detail":"The nature of the Trinity (or Holy Trinity) has caused centuries of argument and division within the Christian faith. The word doesn't actually appear in the Bible itself, but the New Testament does speak of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit together; the Father is understood as the protector of the Jews, the Son as the savior of mankind, and the Holy Spirit as the preserver of the church. Almost all the major Christian sects may be called trinitarian.

(2) Something composed or presented in three sections.","sentence":{"text":"The Renaissance produced many beautiful triptychs portraying religious scenes that are still used as altarpieces.","word":null},"detail":"Triptych contains the root -ptyche, the Greek word for “fold.” So a traditional painted or carved triptych has three hinged panels, and the two outer panels fold in toward the central one. Most triptychs were intended to be mounted over a church altar. Many great triptychs were produced in the Renaissance, perhaps the most famous being Hieronymus Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights. But major triptychs continued to be produced throughout the 20th century by such painters as Francis Bacon.","root":null},{"spell":"trivial","explain":"Of little value or importance.","sentence":{"text":"She was so caught up in the trivial details of the trip that she hardly noticed the beautiful scenery.","word":null},"detail":"Trivial comes from a Latin word meaning “crossroads”—that is, where three roads come together. Since a crossroads is a very public place where all kinds of people might show up, trivialis came to mean “commonplace” or “vulgar.” Today the English word has changed slightly in meaning and instead usually describes something barely worth mentioning. Mathematicians use the word to refer to some part of a proof or definition that's extremely simple and needn't be explained, but the rest of us tend to use it just to mean “unimportant.” “Small talk” at a party, for example, is usually trivial conversation, though a trivial excuse for not going on a date (“I have to wash my hair”) might hide an emotion that isn't so trivial (“I can't stand the sight of you”). To trivialize something is to treat it as if it didn't matter, as if it were just another triviality.","root":null}],"quizzes":[]},{"roots":[{"unit":null,"name":"ANIM","description":"ANIM comes from the Latin anima, meaning “breath” or “soul.” So, for example, an animal is a living, breathing thing—though human animals have often argued about whether other species actually have souls.","words":[{"spell":"animated","explain":"(1) Full of life; lively, vigorous, active.

(2) Generous and forgiving.","sentence":{"text":"She was magnanimous in victory, saying she'd been lucky to win and praising her opponent's effort.","word":null},"detail":"The basic meaning of magnanimity is “greatness of spirit.” Thus, magnanimity is the opposite of pettiness or “smallness.” A truly magnanimous person can lose without complaining and win without gloating. Angry disputes can sometimes be resolved when one side makes a magnanimous gesture toward the other. And it's the mark of magnanimity to give credit to everyone who worked on a project even if you'd rather it all went to you.","root":null},{"spell":"animosity","explain":"Ill will or resentment.","sentence":{"text":"Legend has it that the animosity between the Greeks and the Trojans began with the stealing of the beautiful Helen from her husband, Menelaus.","word":null},"detail":"The important Latin word animus (very closely related to anima) could mean a great many things having to do with the soul and the emotions, one of them being “anger.” As an English word, animus has generally meant “ill will,” so it isn't mysterious that animosity means basically the same thing. Animosity can exist between two people, two groups or organizations, or two countries, and can sometimes lie hidden for years before reappearing. The deep animosities that exist between certain ethnic and religious groups sometimes seem as if they will last forever.","root":null},{"spell":"inanimate","explain":"(1) Not alive; lifeless.

We can literally close the door to a room, or we can figuratively close the door to further negotiations—that is, refuse to take part in them. Figurative language includes figures of speech, such as similes (“she's been like a sister to me”) and metaphors (“a storm of protest”). And sometimes it's hard to tell whether a phrase is literal or figurative: If I say I “picked up” a little Spanish in Mexico, is that literal or figurative? You've probably noticed that lots of the definitions in this book show both a literal meaning (often something physical) and a figurative meaning (often nonphysical).","root":null},{"spell":"configuration","explain":"An arrangement of parts or elements; shape, design.","sentence":{"text":"We've changed the configuration of the office so that employees will have more privacy at their desks.","word":null},"detail":"The term is very common in computer science and mathematics, and in scientific and technological fields in general. Thus, for example, two scientists won a 1962 Nobel Prize for their description of the configuration of the DNA molecule.

The idea was that if anything happened to the body in the afterlife, the effigy could be used as a spare. Effigy now usually refers to crude stuffed figures of the kind that get abused by angry protestors and unruly college students. But the small dolls that witches have used to bring pain and death on their victims can be called effigies as well. Actually, those witches and college kids seem to use their effigies for pretty much the same thing.","root":null},{"spell":"figment","explain":"Something made up or imagined.","sentence":{"text":"His preference for Cindy is a figment of your imagination; believe me, he barely knows she exists.","word":null},"detail":"A figment is something formed from imaginary elements. Daydreams are figments; nightmares are figments that can seem very real. Most figments are everyday fears and hopes about small things that turn out to be imaginary.

Annuities are normally contracts with life-insurance companies that specify that payments begin at retirement. Company pensions are traditionally doled out in the form of annuities, and sweepstakes jackpots may also come as annuities. An annuity can be a wise idea if you think you're going to live a long time; however, annuities can be tricky and should only be purchased after carefully comparing the products offered by various companies.","root":null},{"spell":"superannuated","explain":"(1) Outworn, old-fashioned, or out-of-date.

And a person who has passed an age limit and been forced to retire may technically be called superannuated. But more often superannuated describes people who seem somehow to belong to the past. So a 55-year-old surfer might be regarded as superannuated by the young crowd riding the waves in Santa Cruz, and a superannuated hippie might still be dressing the way he did in 1972.","root":null},{"spell":"millennium","explain":"(1) A period of time lasting 1,000 years, or the celebration of a 1,000-year anniversary.

Thus, we're living today at the beginning of the third millennium since the birth of Christ. But some religious sects, relying on a prophecy in the biblical Book of Revelation, speak of a coming millennium when Jesus will return to reign on earth for 1,000 years, evil will be banished, and all will live in peace and happiness.

(Annuals, by contrast, grow for only a single season and must be replanted annually, and biennials die after two years.) Evergreens are perennially green; for that reason, they're perennial favorites for Christmas wreaths and decorations.

Thus, astronomers might speak of one galaxy as being coeval with another, and a period in the history of one civilization might be coeval with a similar period in another.

But the most impressive human longevity is nothing compared to the 400-year lifespan of an ocean clam found near Iceland, or the 5,000-year lifespan of the bristlecone pine, a tree found in the western U.S. We may use longevity to talk not only about actual lives but also of the useful “life” of things: the life of your car's tires or the shingles on your roof, for example.","root":null},{"spell":"medieval","explain":"(1) Relating to the Middle Ages of European history, from about A.D. 500 to 1500. (2) Extremely out-of-date.","sentence":{"text":"The great cathedral at Chartres in France, finished in 1220, is a masterpiece of medieval architecture.","word":null},"detail":"With its roots medi-, meaning “middle,” and ev-, meaning “age,” medieval literally means “of the Middle Ages.” In this case, middle means “between the Roman empire and the Renaissance”—that is, after the fall of the great Roman state and before the “rebirth” of culture that we call the Renaissance. This same period used to be called the “Dark Ages,” since it was believed that in these years civilization all but vanished. And indeed, for most Europeans in these centuries, it was a time of poverty, famine, plague, and superstition, rather than the age of magic, dazzling swordplay, towering castles, and knights in splendid armor displayed in today's graphic novels and video games.","root":null},{"spell":"primeval","explain":"(1) Having to do with the earliest ages; primitive or ancient. (2) Existing from the beginning.","sentence":{"text":"When European settlers first arrived in North America, they found vast tracts of primeval forest, seemingly untouched by human influence.","word":null},"detail":"With its prim- prefix, meaning “first,” primeval obviously refers to an original age. So the word often suggests the earliest periods in the earth's history. Myths are often stories of the creation of the world and of its primeval beings. The trees in a primeval forest (few of which remain today in most countries) may be 400 years old—not as old as the world, but maybe as old as they ever live to. According to scientists, life on earth began in the protein-rich waters of the primeval seas and swamps, and the decay of their tiny organisms and plant matter over millions of years produced our petroleum and coal.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"CORP","description":"CORP comes from corpus, the Latin word for “body.” A corpse is a dead body.

In earlier times in Europe, being overweight was considered a sign of wealth and well-being, as demonstrated by the corpulence of many European kings. Still today, corpulence is thought to be superior to thinness in some of the world's cultures.

But today execution comes under the separate heading of “capital punishment,” which originally involved losing your head (capit- meaning “head”). Milder forms of corporal punishment are used by American parents, and were once common in schools as well. Corporal is occasionally used in other ways; in the traditional church, the “corporal works of mercy” include seven helpful acts such as sheltering the homeless and burying the dead. Corporal as a military rank actually comes from caporal—which has the same root as capital.","root":null},{"spell":"incorporate","explain":"(1) To blend or combine into something already existing to form one whole. (2) To form or form into a corporation.","sentence":{"text":"The new edition incorporates many suggestions and corrections received by the author from his readers.","word":null},"detail":"From its roots, incorporate means basically “add into a body” or “form into a body.” So, for example, a chef might decide to incorporate a couple of new ingredients into an old recipe, and then might incorporate that new item into the restaurant's dinner menu. The restaurant itself was probably incorporated at the beginning, and so is now a corporation—that is, a “body” that's legally allowed to act like a single person in certain ways, even if it may have many individual employees.

When we say that the tension in a room is tangible, we mean we feel it so strongly that it seems almost physical. But if we're being literal, tension, like hope, happiness, and hunger, is literally intangible—it may be real, but it can't be touched.

Codices (note this unusual plural form) were usually written on parchment, the specially prepared skin of a sheep or goat, or papyrus, the ancestor of paper.

Not all lying is perjury, only lying under oath; so perjury generally takes place either in court or before a legislative body such as Congress. To avoid committing perjury, a witness or defendant may “take the Fifth”: that is, refuse to answer a question because the answer might be an admission of guilt, and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution forbids forcing a citizen to admit to being guilty of a crime.","root":null},{"spell":"de","explain":"jure Based on or according to the law.","sentence":{"text":"The country is a de jure democracy, but since one party controls all the media outlets it really isn't one.","word":null},"detail":"Coming straight from Latin, de jure is a term used mostly, but not always, in legal writing. Sometimes it's not enough to have something written into law; if a law isn't enforced, it might as well not exist. And if ordinary citizens are too scared of what would happen to them if they exercised their rights, then they don't really have those rights at all. Unfortunately, many countries have constitutions and laws that sound good but turn out not to have much effect.

Animal and plant products are normally biodegradable, but mineral substances such as metals, glass, and plastics usually are not. Newly developed biodegradable plastics are now appearing in numerous products. However, “biodegradable” products can vary greatly in how long they take to break down.

The effects of refraction can be seen in a rainbow, which is formed when light rays passing into (and reflecting out of) water droplets are bent at different angles depending on their color, so that the light separates into bands of color. The amount of refraction depends on the angle and the type of matter; refraction can occur even when passing through different kinds of air.

Comprehend is thus often a bit stronger than understand: for example, you may understand the instructions in a handbook without completely comprehending their purpose. Comprehend's second meaning is much less common. Using that sense of the word, we could say that good manners comprehends (that is, includes) more than simple table etiquette, for example, or that true courage comprehends more than just physical showing off.

Reprehensible is applied to both things and people—that is, both the sin and the sinner.

To temperance leaders such as Carry Nation, the safest form of drinking was no alcohol at all. Believing she was upholding the law, Nation began her hatchet-swinging attacks on saloons, known as “hatchetations,” in the 1890s.

A religious fanatic is likely to preach with intemperate zeal, and a mean theater critic may become intemperate in her criticism of a new play, filling her review with intemperate language.

The distemper that affects dogs, often called canine distemper, also affects foxes, wolves, mink, raccoons, and ferrets. It can be treated with medication, but is generally fatal if not treated. Distemper in cats, known as feline distemper or panleukopenia, actually isn't related to canine distemper. If caught quickly, it too can be treated.

For centuries, doctors prescribed purgatives—that is, laxatives—for all kinds of ailments, not knowing anything better to do. Physical cleansing has always reminded people of emotional and spiritual cleansing, as expressed in the saying “Cleanliness is next to godliness.” So we may say, for example, that confession has a purgative effect on the soul.

Thus, a metaphor transfers the meaning of one word or phrase to another. Metaphors often include a form of the verb be (as in the examples above), and they're often contrasted with similes, which are usually introduced by like or as (“O, my luve's like a red, red rose”). But, they don't have to include be; when you say that the teacher gave us a mountain of homework or that we're drowning in paperwork, these too are metaphorical statements.","root":null},{"spell":"metaphysics","explain":"The part of philosophy having to do with the ultimate causes and basic nature of things.","sentence":{"text":"Most of the congregation prefers to hear their minister preach about virtue, and they get restless when his sermons head in the direction of metaphysics.","word":null},"detail":"Just as physics deals with the laws that govern the physical world (such as those of gravity or the properties of waves), metaphysics describes what is beyond physics—the nature and origin of reality itself, the immortal soul, and the existence of a supreme being. Opinions about these metaphysical topics vary widely, since what's being discussed can't be observed or measured or even truly known to exist. So most metaphysical questions are still as far from a final answer as they were when Plato and Aristotle were asking them.","root":null},{"spell":"metonymy","explain":"A figure of speech in which the name of one thing is used for the name of something else that is associated with it or related to it.","sentence":{"text":"When Wall Street has the jitters, the White House issues a statement, and the people wait for answers from City Hall, metonymy is having a busy day.","word":null},"detail":"At first glance, metaphor and metonymy seem close in meaning, but there are differences. In a metaphor we substitute one thing for something else that's usually quite different; for example, Web for a worldwide network of linked computers and their technology. In metonymy, we replace one word or phrase (such as “stock market” or “local government officials” in the examples above) with another word or phrase associated with it. Most familiar metonyms are place-names, such as Hollywood for “the film industry,” or K Street for “Washington lobbyists.” But saying “the press” to refer to the news media, or “sweat” to refer to hard work, could also be called metonymy.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"PER","description":"PER is a Latin preposition that generally means “through,” “throughout,” or “thoroughly.” Thus, perforate means “to bore through,” perennial means “throughout the years,” and permanent means “remaining throughout.” And the “thoroughly” sense shows up in persuade, for “thoroughly advise,” and perverted, “thoroughly turned around.”","words":[{"spell":"percolate","explain":"(1) To trickle or filter through something porous. (2) To become spread through.","sentence":{"text":"She tells herself that the money she spends on luxuries eventually percolates down to the needy.","word":null},"detail":"Percolate comes from a Latin verb meaning “to put through a sieve.” Something that percolates filters through something else, just as small particles pass through a sieve. Water is drawn downward through the soil, and this percolation usually cleans the water. A slow rain is ideal for percolating into the soil, since in a violent rainstorm most of it quickly runs off. For this reason, drip irrigation is the most effective and water-conserving form of irrigation. Percolation isn't always a physical process; awareness of an issue may percolate slowly into the minds of the public, just as Spanish words may gradually percolate into English, often starting in the Southwest.","root":null},{"spell":"pervade","explain":"To spread through all parts of something.","sentence":{"text":"We all knew that more job cuts were coming, and the entire office was pervaded with anxiety.","word":null},"detail":"Pervade can be used to describe something physical: a chemical odor may pervade a building, for example, and most scientists believe that outer space is pervaded by mysterious “dark matter.” But the word usually doesn't refer to anything that could be detected by scientific instruments. Thus, humor may pervade a novel, gloom may pervade a gathering, and corruption may pervade a government. And something pervasive exists in every part of something: fatherlessness may be a pervasive problem in poor neighborhoods, for instance, and pervasive optimism sometimes causes the stock market to soar.","root":null},{"spell":"permeate","explain":"(1) To spread throughout. (2) To pass through the pores or small openings of.","sentence":{"text":"On Saturday mornings back in those days, the aroma of fresh pies and breads would permeate almost every house on the block.","word":null},"detail":"Permeate is often a synonym for pervade. We could say, for example, that at exam time the campus is either “permeated” or “pervaded” by a sense of dread. But the two words aren't identical. For one thing, permeate can mean simply “pass through,” and is often used when talking about liquids; thus, a boot can be permeated by water, though certain oils make leather less permeable, and you might just want to buy boots made of impermeable material. And things may “pass through” in a nonphysical way as well; so you might say that anxiety about climate change has started to permeate into the public's consciousness—but once anxiety has become pervasive it's pretty much taken over.","root":null},{"spell":"persevere","explain":"To keep at something in spite of difficulties, opposition, or discouragement.","sentence":{"text":"For ten years she persevered in her effort to find out what the government knew about her husband's disappearance.","word":null},"detail":"The early settlers of the New World persevered in the face of constant hardship and danger. The Pilgrims of Plymouth Plantation lost half their number in the first winter to disease and hunger, but their perseverance paid off, and within five years their community was healthy and self-sufficient. Perhaps more remarkable are all the solitary inventors who have persevered in pursuing their visions for years, lacking any financial support and laughed at by the public.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"ANT/ANTI","description":"ANT/ANTI is a Latin prefix meaning “against.” An anticlimax is the opposite of a climax.

Pro- and ant- usually mark the good and bad characters, but not always; there may occasionally be an evil protagonist and a good antagonist. In the drama of the real world, it's especially hard to sort out which is which, so we usually speak of both parties to a conflict as antagonists. During a strike, for example, representatives of labor and management become antagonists; they often manage to antagonize each other, and the antagonism often remains after the strike is over.","root":null},{"spell":"antigen","explain":"A chemical substance (such as a protein) that, when introduced into the body, causes the body to form antibodies against it.","sentence":{"text":"When the immune system is weak, it may not be able to produce enough antibodies to combat the invading antigens.","word":null},"detail":"An antibody is a protein produced by your immune system to fight outside invaders. Since the enemy substance actually triggers the production of antibodies, such substances are called antigens—anti- being short for antibody, and -gen meaning “producer.” (In a similar way, an allergen produces an allergy, and a pathogen produces a pathology or disease.) Antigens are often rodlike structures that stick out from the surface of an invading organism—usually a bacterium or a virus—and allow it to attach itself to cells in the invaded body. But unfortunately for them, in doing so they let the immune system know they're present, and the body is flooded with an army of Pac-Man-like antibodies.","root":null},{"spell":"antipathy","explain":"A strong dislike.","sentence":{"text":"It seemed odd that he could feel such intense antipathy for someone he'd only met once, and we suspected there was more to the story.","word":null},"detail":"When the nation of Yugoslavia was created in 1945, it combined a number of ethnic groups with a history of violent antipathy toward each other. In 1991– 92 four regions of the country announced that they would become independent nations; a bloody six-year war followed, fueled by these ancient and powerful antipathies. The American Civil War similarly resulted from antipathy between the North and the South. But in the U.S.'s relations with its next-door neighbors, it's been a long time since emotions have gotten much stronger than annoyance.","root":null},{"spell":"antithesis","explain":"(1) The contrast or opposition of ideas. (2) The exact opposite.","sentence":{"text":"Life on the small college campus, with its personal freedom and responsibility, was the antithesis of what many students had known in high school.","word":null},"detail":"Writers and speechmakers use the traditional pattern known as antithesis for its resounding effect; John Kennedy's famous “ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country” is an example. But antithesis normally means simply “opposite.” Thus, war is the antithesis of peace, wealth is the antithesis of poverty, and love is the antithesis of hate. Holding two antithetical ideas in one's head at the same time—for example, that you're the sole master of your fate but also the helpless victim of your terrible upbringing—is so common as to be almost normal.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"CONTRA","description":"CONTRA is the Latin equivalent of anti-, and it too means essentially “against” or “contrary to.” A contrast “stands against” something else that it's compared to.

This led to the Italian word contrabbando, from which we get contraband. Contraband items aren't always illegal; they may simply be things (such as cigarettes) that are meant to be taxed. So a dealer in untaxed contraband can charge a little less and still make enormous profits. Of course, if the item is actually forbidden, like illegal drugs, then the profits could be much greater.","root":null},{"spell":"contraindication","explain":"Something (such as a symptom or condition) that makes a particular treatment, medication, or procedure likely to be unsafe.","sentence":{"text":"A history of stomach ulcers is a contraindication to regular use of aspirin.","word":null},"detail":"For doctors, an indication is a symptom or circumstance that makes a particular medical treatment desirable. Serious anxiety, for example, is often an indication for prescribing a tranquilizer. A contraindication, then, is a symptom or condition that makes a treatment risky, such as taking certain other medications at the same time. Drugs and conditions that are contraindicated for a medication are listed on its label, and reeled off at high speed in TV ads. Patients can guard against the dangers of drug interaction by reading labels carefully and making sure their doctors know what else they're currently taking.","root":null},{"spell":"contravene","explain":"(1) To go against or act contrary to; to violate. (2) To oppose in an argument, to contradict.","sentence":{"text":"The power company was found to be contravening state and federal environmental standards for wastewater discharged into bodies of water.","word":null},"detail":"Contravene is most often used in reference to laws. So a government may take a company to court claiming that its policies are in contravention of national labor laws. The contravention of copyright laws is a big topic today especially where electronic information is involved. And a country might be punished if a trade organization finds that it's contravening international trade agreements.","root":null},{"spell":"contrarian","explain":"A person who takes a contrary position or attitude, especially an investor who buys shares of stock when most others are selling or sells when others are buying.","sentence":{"text":"My father was basically a contrarian, who never accepted the common wisdom and loved nothing so much as a good argument.","word":null},"detail":"Anyone who thinks that most of what the public believes is wrong would be called a contrarian. And contrarian is a basic term in the vocabulary of investing. In fact, most successful investors often behave like contrarians by “buying low and selling high”—that is, buying stocks that are cheap because most investors put a low value on them but that have the possibility of rising, and selling stocks that most investors are valuing highly but that seem likely to decline.

These death's-heads or skulls may strike us as ghoulish, but they helped keep the living on the straight and narrow for fear of eternal punishment. In earlier centuries, an educated European might place an actual skull on his desk to keep the idea of death always present in his mind.","root":null},{"spell":"habeas","explain":"corpus An order to bring a jailed person before a judge or court to find out if that person should really be in jail.","sentence":{"text":"The country has a primitive legal system with no right of habeas corpus, and suspects often are shot before they ever see a judge.","word":null},"detail":"The literal meaning of habeas corpus is “You shall have the body”—that is, the judge must have the person charged with a crime brought into the courtroom to hear what he's been charged with. Through much of human history, and in many countries still today, a person may be imprisoned on the orders of someone in the government and kept behind bars for years without ever getting a chance to defend himself, or even knowing what he's done wrong.

The condition results from a lack of certain chemicals in the muscles; it may be affected by muscular activity before death as well as the external temperature. Mystery writers frequently make use of rigor mortis as a means by which the detective or the examiner can determine the time of the victim's death, which often turns out to be all-important in solving the case.","root":null},{"spell":"sine","explain":"qua non An essential thing.","sentence":{"text":"Good planning is the sine qua non of a successful dinner party.","word":null},"detail":"Sine qua non can be translated literally as “Without which, not.” Though this may sound like gibberish, it means more or less “Without (something), (something else) won't be possible.” Sine qua non sounds slightly literary, and it shouldn't be used just anywhere.

High-school teachers often put strictures on texting during class. Cities concerned about their murder rate have slapped strictures on the possession of handguns. And the United Nations may vote to put strictures on arms sales to a country that keeps violating international treaties. With the meaning “strong criticism,” stricture is slightly old-fashioned today, but it's still used by intellectuals.

These are now illegal, though other kinds of restrictive covenants are very common; in some neighborhoods, they may even tell you what colors you can't paint your house. In grammar, a restrictive clause is one that limits the meaning of something that comes before it. In the sentence “That's the professor who I'm trying to avoid,” “who I'm trying to avoid” is a restrictive clause, since it's what identifies the professor. But in the sentence “That's my History professor, who I'm trying to avoid,” the same clause is nonrestrictive, since the professor has already been identified as “my History professor.” There should always be a comma before a nonrestrictive clause, but not before a restrictive clause.","root":null},{"spell":"constrict","explain":"(1) To draw together or make narrow.

Its root meaning of “twisted” (as opposed to “straight”) obviously came to mean “wrong” (as opposed to “right”). Every first-year law student takes a course in the important subject of torts. Torts include all the so-called “product-liability” cases, against manufacturers of cars, household products, children's toys, and so on. They also cover dog bites, slander and libel, and a huge variety of other very personal cases of injury, both mental and physical—Torts class is never dull.

(2) Slavishly obedient.","sentence":{"text":"Many have wondered why Congress always seems subservient to the financial industry, supporting it even when the voters are angrily calling for reforms.","word":null},"detail":"Since sub- means “below,” it emphasizes the lower position of the person in the subservient one. Soldiers of a given rank are always subservient to those of a higher rank; this subservience is symbolized by the requirement that they salute their superior at every opportunity.

Almost all heart attacks are the result of the occlusion of a coronary (heart) artery by a blood clot, and many strokes are caused by an occlusion in an artery serving the brain. When a person's upper and lower teeth form a malocclusion, they close incorrectly or badly.

When the word appears in an advertisement, it's often making an appeal to snobs. An “exclusive” offer is supposedly made to only a few people; not so many years ago, “exclusive” housing developments excluded those of a certain race or color. If a product is being sold exclusively by one store, you won't be able to find it anywhere else. When a newspaper or news show has an exclusive, it's a story that no one else has yet reported.

She had been a great international star, called the most beautiful woman in the world; he had been an aircraft manufacturer and film producer, with one of the greatest fortunes in the world.

But the word can't always be taken quite literally as a brand or company name; it's possible, for instance, that something called the Acme Bar & Grill may not be the absolutely highest and best example of a bar and grill.

Sigmund Freud borrowed the term as a name for the process of bringing a set of unconscious desires and ideas back into consciousness in order to eliminate their bad effects. Today some people claim it's cathartic to merely express your anger or grief, since it “gets it out of your system.” Laxatives are also called cathartic, since they provide a physical catharsis that some people believe to be healthful.

Today it's generally used by people who think of themselves as superior—though it's also sometimes used in Pericles' democratic spirit. By the way, it has no relation to hoity-toity, meaning “stuck-up,” which starts with the same sound but has nothing to do with Greek.","root":null},{"spell":"kudos","explain":"(1) Fame and renown that result from an achievement; prestige. (2) Praise.","sentence":{"text":"His first film earned him kudos at the independent film festivals, and the big studios were soon calling him up.","word":null},"detail":"Kudos is an odd word in English. In Greek, kydos meant “glory” or “prestige”; in other words, it wasn't something you could count. But in English kudos looks like a plural and is therefore often treated as one.

When the plural form stigmata is used, it usually refers to the nail wounds on Christ's hands and feet, wounds which have sometimes reappeared on the hands or feet of later worshippers such as St. Francis. When stigma began to be used in English, it usually meant the kind of mark or stain you can't actually see. So today we hear about the stigma of homelessness, the stigma of overweight, and the stigma of mental illness.

But some people are able to win favor just by relying on their ingratiating smiles.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"CLAM/CLAIM","description":"CLAM/CLAIM comes from the Latin verb clamare, meaning “to shout or cry out.” To claim often means “to call for.” And an exclamation is a cry of shock, joy, or surprise.","words":[{"spell":"clamor","explain":"(1) Noisy shouting; loud, continuous noise.

The clamor on the floor of a stock exchange goes on without stopping for seven hours every day. A clamor of protest may sometimes be quieter, but is often just as hard to ignore.

An acclaimed movie is widely praised, and critical acclaim can lead to box-office success. When a popular proposal comes up in a legislature, the speaker may ask that it be passed “by acclamation,” which means that everyone just gets to yell and cheer in approval and no one bothers counting the votes at all.","root":null},{"spell":"declaim","explain":"To speak in the formal manner of someone delivering a speech.","sentence":{"text":"Almost any opinion can sound convincing if it's declaimed loudly and with conviction.","word":null},"detail":"Declaiming suggests an unnatural style of speech best suited to a stage or podium. Listening to an actor declaim a passage in a Shakespeare play can be enjoyable. Listening to Aunt Ida at Sunday dinner declaiming on the virtues of roughage might not be.

We often think of proclamations as something issued by monarchs or dictators, but Lincoln was able to issue his Emancipation Proclamation because as president he had the power to free the slaves in certain areas.

The idea of a bureaucracy is to split up the complicated task of governing a large country into smaller jobs that can be handled by specialists.

So a plutocracy governs or wields power through its money. The economic growth in the U.S. in the late 19th century produced a group of enormously wealthy plutocrats. Huge companies like John D.

Ruthless businessmen steal clients and contracts from other businessmen without compunction, and hardened criminals have no compunctions about armed robbery and worse. Notice how compunction can be used in a noncountable way, like guilt (“He killed without compunction”), or in the plural, like qualm (”She had no compunctions about lying”).

An acupuncturist may insert many extremely fine needles at a time; the treatment is usually uncomfortable but not truly painful. In China today, even major surgery is often carried out using only acupuncture to kill the pain; it's also used for many other conditions, including insomnia, depression, smoking, and overweight.

But when a person or thing “has potential,” we always expect something good from it in the future. As an adjective (as in “potential losses,” “potential benefits,” etc.), potential usually means simply “possible.” In science, however, the adjective has a special meaning: Potential energy is the kind of stored energy that a boulder sitting at the top of a cliff has (the opposite of kinetic energy, which is what it has as it rolls down that cliff).","root":null},{"spell":"impotent","explain":"Lacking power or strength.","sentence":{"text":"The government now knows it's utterly impotent to stop the violence raging in the countryside, and has basically retreated to the capital city.","word":null},"detail":"A police department may be impotent to stop the flow of drugs into a neighborhood.

Both may have been divine forms of honey. The gods also used nectar and ambrosia like oils for ceremonial anointing, and a mixture of water, oil, and fruits called ambrosia came to be used in human ceremonies as well.

The story goes that the Greek inventor Archimedes, given the task of determining the purity of gold in a crown, shouted “Eureka!” one day after stepping into a bath and making water slop over the side, when he suddenly realized that the weight of water displaced indicated the bulk of his body, but that a larger body made of lighter matter might weigh the same but would displace more water.

Thus, you may have no objection to educational testing per se, but rather to the way testing is done. An opposition party may attack a president's policy not because they dislike the policy per se but because they want to weaken the president.

But opus normally is used for musical works. Mendelssohn's Opus 90 is his Italian Symphony, for example, and Brahms's Op. 77 is his Violin Concerto. Since many composers' works were never given opus numbers in an orderly way, they now often have catalog numbers assigned by later scholars.

The need to earn a living provides many people with the impetus to drag themselves out of bed five mornings a week. On the other two days, the impetus might be the smell of bacon cooking, or the idea of an early-morning round of golf.

In many fields, a final thesis is the biggest challenge involved in getting a master's degree, and the same is true for students studying for a Ph.D. (a Ph.D. thesis is often called a dissertation).

But that kind of personal command is rarely the meaning of mandate today; much more common are connected with institutions. Thus, the Clean Air Act was a mandate from Congress to clean up air pollution—and since mandate is also a verb, we could say instead that the Clear Air Act mandated new restrictions on air pollution. Elections are often interpreted as mandates from the public for certain kinds of action.

Almost anything—food, supplies, livestock, etc.—can be militarily commandeered when the need arises. But you don't have to be in the military for someone to “pull rank” on you: Your father may commandeer the car just when you were about to take it out for the evening, your teacher may commandeer your cell phone as you're texting in the middle of class, or your older sister may commandeer the TV remote to watch some lousy dancing competition.","root":null},{"spell":"remand","explain":"(1) To order a case sent back to another court or agency for further action.

Its original meaning was simply “overflow.” But since the prefix re- often means “back,” the later meaning “result” may have arisen because flowing back—on a beach, for example—is a result of the original flowing. Redound has long been confused with other words such as resound and rebound, so today “rebound” is another of its standard meanings. As examples of its usual meaning, we could say that the prohibition of alcohol in 1919 redounded unintentionally to the benefit of gangsters such as Al Capone—and that Capone's jailing on tax-evasion charges redounded to the credit of the famous “Untouchables.”","root":null},{"spell":"redundancy","explain":"(1) The state of being extra or unnecessary.

Thus, sanctity means “holiness.” In ancient Greece, a spot could be sanctified, or “made holy,” by a group of priests who carried out a solemn ritual; these might be spots where fumes arose from a crack in the earth or where a spring of clear water flowed out of the ground, and a temple might be built there for worship of a god.","words":[{"spell":"sanction","explain":"To give approval to.","sentence":{"text":"The bill's opponents claimed that removing criminal penalties for drug possession would amount to sanctioning drug use.","word":null},"detail":"Sanction originally meant “make holy” or “give official church approval to.” The word still has a solemn sound to it, so sanctioning is something generally done by an institution or government, though not necessarily by a church. So a college may sanction—or “give its blessing to”—the use of office space by a gay organization, or a hot-rod association may sanction two new tracks for official races. But sanction is also a noun, which may have two near-opposite meanings, “approval” and “penalty.” Thus, a company may be accused of giving its sanction to illegal activities.

But sacrosanct is now used to describe a questionable sacredness which nevertheless makes something immune from attack or violation; that is, the person using the word usually doesn't regard the thing as sacred at all. So to call a government program sacrosanct is to imply that others regard it as untouchable.

In Anglo-Saxon England, churches and churchyards generally provided 40 days of immunity, and neither the sheriffs nor the army would enter to seize the outlaw. But gradually the right of sanctuary was eroded. In 1486 sanctuary for the crime of treason was disallowed, and sanctuary for most other crimes was severely restricted by Henry VIII and later abolished. In the 1980s many U.S. churches provided sanctuary to political refugees from Central America, and the U.S. government mostly chose not to interfere.

The soliloquies of Shakespeare—in Hamlet (“To be or not to be”), Macbeth (“Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow”), Romeo and Juliet (“But soft! what light from yonder window breaks”), etc.—are the most famous, but modern playwrights such as Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, and Sam Shepard have also employed them.","root":null},{"spell":"colloquial","explain":"Conversational in style.","sentence":{"text":"The author, though obviously a professional writer, uses a colloquial style in this new book.","word":null},"detail":"Since colloquy means basically “conversation,” colloquial language is the language almost all of us speak.

But our language usually changes when we write, becoming more formal and sometimes even “literary.” Except in e-mails and text messages, many people never write a contraction or use the word “I”, and avoid informal words completely.

Loquacious letters used to go on for pages, and a loquacious author might produce a 1,200-page novel. Lincoln's brief 269-word Gettysburg Address was delivered after a two-hour, 13,000-word speech by America's most famous orator, a windbag of loquacity.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"VIR","description":"VIR is Latin for “man.” A virtue is a good quality—originally, the kind of quality an ideal man possessed.

A masterful and dominating manner, a splendid bared chest, a full head of lustrous hair, and an array of stunning costumes seem to be what's required. (Virile traits often missing in these men are hair on the chest and any hint of future baldness.)

(2) A group or association of three.","sentence":{"text":"A triumvirate slowly emerged as the inner circle of the White House, and the vice president wasn't among them.","word":null},"detail":"The first triumvirate of the Roman Republic, which consisted of Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, was simply an alliance or partnership, not a formal institution of the government. The alliance didn't last long, however, and Caesar eventually emerged with total power. This led to his assassination, after which a second triumvirate took over, with Octavian, Mark Antony, and Lepidus dividing the Roman world among themselves. But these triumvirs also soon turned on one another, with Octavian alone taking power; in time he would become Rome's first emperor.","root":null},{"spell":"virago","explain":"A loud, bad-tempered, overbearing woman.","sentence":{"text":"The staff called her a virago and other things behind her back, but everyone was respectful of her abilities.","word":null},"detail":"The original Latin meaning of virago was “female warrior.” But in later centuries the meaning shifted toward the negative. The most famous virago in English literature is the ferocious Kate in Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Some historical viragoes have also become famous. Agrippina poisoned her husband, the Emperor Claudius, so that her son Nero could take his place (but it was Nero himself who eventually had her assassinated). And Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, a powerful virago of the 12th century, was imprisoned by her husband, King Henry II of England, after she encouraged their sons to rebel against him.

Smallpox was prevalent on several continents for many centuries, and when Europeans brought it with them to the Americas, it killed more American Indians than the armed settlers did. But prevalent doesn't just describe diseases. One ideal of male or female beauty may be prevalent in a particular society and quite a different ideal in another.

A crescent wrench, with its open end (unlike the kind of wrench that has an almost circular end), can be found in almost any household. A croissant, or crescent pastry, is a breakfast staple.

Any accretion of ice on a grounded jet will result in takeoff delays because of the danger it poses. The land area of the Mississippi Delta increases every year from the accretion of soil washed down the Mississippi River, though the accretions happen so slowly that it's difficult to detect any increase at all.

Incremental increases in drug dosages are used for experimental purposes. Incremental tax increases are easier to swallow than sudden large increases. Incremental changes of any kind may be hard to notice, but can be very significant in the long run.

Some patients were transfused with animal blood, and so many died as a result that by 1700 transfusions had been widely outlawed. Not until 1900 were the major blood groups (A, B, AB, and O) recognized, making transfusions safe and effective.","root":null},{"spell":"effusive","explain":"(1) Given to excessive display of feeling. (2) Freely expressed.","sentence":{"text":"At the victory party she lavished effusive praise on all her supporters for almost half an hour.","word":null},"detail":"Since to effuse is to “pour out,” an effusive person makes a habit of pouring out emotions. Greeting someone effusively may include great hugs and wet kisses. Academy Award winners tend to become embarrassingly effusive once they've got the microphone. But at least effusiveness is generally an expression of positive rather than negative emotions.","root":null},{"spell":"profusion","explain":"Great abundance.","sentence":{"text":"In May the trees and flowers bloom with almost delirious profusion.","word":null},"detail":"A profusion is literally a “pouring forth,” so a profusion of gifts is a wealth or abundance of gifts.

A face may be suffused (that is, filled, but also probably flushed) with joy, or hope, or love. A novel may be suffused with Irish humor, and a room may be suffused with firelight.

An apology includes an admission of wrongdoing, but an apologia rarely apologizes in this sense, instead seeking to justify what was done. So, for example, in 1992 some of the books published for the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage were apologias explaining why European powers such as Spain acted as they did in the New World: because, for example, the Aztecs were a cruel people, practicing human sacrifice in grotesque ways (victims were skinned, and their skins were worn by the high priests), and Christianity hoped to reform them. Of course, the Spanish Inquisition was torturing and executing nonbelievers at the same time—but that would be the subject of other apologias.","root":null},{"spell":"atrium","explain":"(1) An open rectangular patio around which a house is built.

But the original atria (notice the unusual plural) were open to the sky and occupied the center of a house or villa in ancient Rome. The open Roman courtyard allowed air to circulate and light to enter, and even its plantings helped cool the house. Situating the cooking fireplace in the atrium was another way of keeping the house itself cool. Still today, houses around the Mediterranean Sea and in tropical Latin America often have internal courtyards.","root":null},{"spell":"oligarchy","explain":"A government in which power is in the hands of a small group.","sentence":{"text":"The population was shackled by an iron-willed oligarchy that dictated every aspect of their lives and ruthlessly crushed any hint of rebellion.","word":null},"detail":"Oligarchy combines roots from the Greek words oligos, meaning “few,” and archos, meaning “leader or ruler.” In ancient Greece, an aristocracy was government by the “best” (in Greek, aristos) citizens. An oligarchy was a corrupted aristocracy, one in which a few evil men unjustly seized power and used it to further their own ends. Since at least 1542, oligarchy has been used in English to describe oppressive governments of the kind that serve the interests of a few very wealthy families.","root":null},{"spell":"encomium","explain":"Glowing, enthusiastic praise, or an expression of such praise.","sentence":{"text":"The surprise guest at the farewell party was the school's most famous graduate, who delivered a heartfelt encomium to the woman he called his favorite teacher of all.","word":null},"detail":"Encomium comes straight from Latin. Mark Antony's encomium to the dead Caesar in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar (“Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears”) is one of the most famous encomiums of all time, while Ben Jonson's encomium to the dead Shakespeare (“He was not of an age, but for all time”) has also been widely read and discussed. The British poet laureate is expected to compose poetic encomiums to mark special events or to praise a person honored by the state.

A superstitious person who compulsively knocks on wood or avoids anything with the number 13 might be suffering from a harmless neurosis. But a severe neurosis such as agoraphobia (see agoraphobia) can be very harmful, making a person a prisoner of his or her home. Neurosis is based on the Greek word for “nerve,” since until quite recently neurotic behavior was often blamed on the nerves. Neurosis is usually contrasted with psychosis, which includes a considerably more serious group of conditions.","root":null},{"spell":"opprobrium","explain":"(1) Something that brings disgrace. (2) A public disgrace that results from conduct considered wrong or bad.","sentence":{"text":"The writers of the New Testament hold the Pharisees up to opprobrium for their hypocrisy and hollow spirituality.","word":null},"detail":"Witches have long been the objects of opprobrium; in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, women thought to be witches were burned by the thousands. The opprobrious crime of treason could likewise result in the most hideous torture and execution. In The Scarlet Letter, the sin of adultery in Puritan times brought opprobrium on Hester Prynne.

Thus, a referendum is a measure that's referred (that is, sent on) to the people. Since the U.S. Constitution doesn't provide for referenda (notice the common plural form) at the national level, referenda tend to be on local and state issues. In most locales, a few questions usually appear on the ballot at election time, often involving such issues as new zoning ordinances, new taxes for schools, and new limits on spending.","root":null},{"spell":"ultimatum","explain":"A final proposal, condition, or demand, especially one whose rejection will result in forceful action.","sentence":{"text":"The ultimatum to Iraq in 1991 demanding that it withdraw from Kuwait was ignored, and a U.S.-led invasion was the response.","word":null},"detail":"An ultimatum is usually issued by a stronger power to a weaker one, since it wouldn't carry much weight if the one giving the ultimatum couldn't back up its threat. Near the end of World War II, the Allied powers issued an ultimatum to Japan: surrender completely or face the consequences.

Sayings such as “A stitch in time saves nine,” or “Pride goeth before a fall,” or “Least said, soonest mended,” or “To everything there is a season” are easily memorized nuggets of wisdom. But the convenient thing about proverbs is that there's often one for every point of view. For every “Look before you leap” there's a “He who hesitates is lost.” “A fool and his money are soon parted” can be countered with “To make money you have to spend money.” A cynic once observed, “Proverbs are invaluable treasures to dunces with good memories.”","root":null},{"spell":"verbatim","explain":"In the exact words; word for word.","sentence":{"text":"It turned out that the writer had lifted long passages verbatim from an earlier, forgotten biography of the statesman.","word":null},"detail":"Verbatim comes directly from Latin into English with the same spelling and meaning. Memorizing famous speeches, poems, or literary passages is a good way to both train the memory and absorb the classic texts of our literature and culture. At one time the ability to recite verbatim the Gettysburg Address, the beginning of the Declaration of Independence, and great speeches from Shakespeare was the mark of a well-educated person.

Legal documents are also generally full of verbiage, partly because lawyers want to be sure that every last possibility has been covered and no loopholes have been left.

In fact, the oldest literature known to us uses similes, along with their close relatives known as metaphors (see metaphorical). This suggests that similes are an essential part of imaginative writing in all times and all cultures. When Tennyson, describing an eagle, writes “And like a thunderbolt he falls,” he's using a simile, since the line makes a specific comparison. “The road was a ribbon of moonlight” could be called a metaphor, though “The road was like a ribbon of moonlight” would be a simile.","root":null},{"spell":"assimilate","explain":"(1) To take in and thoroughly understand.

In a similar way, a fact can be taken into the mind, thoroughly digested, and absorbed into one's store of knowledge. A newcomer to a job or a subject must assimilate an often confusing mass of information; only after it's been thoroughly absorbed can the person make intelligent use of it.

People of higher rank, power, or social position had to overlook certain established rules of behavior if they wished to have social dealings with people of lower status, but such condescension was usually gracious and courteous. In today's more classless society, the term implies a manner that may be slightly offensive. A poor relation is unlikely to be grateful to a wealthy and condescending relative who passes on her secondhand clothes, and employees at an office party may not be thrilled when the boss's wife condescends to mingle with them.

Common eponymous terms include Ohm's law, Parkinson's Law, and the Peter Principle.

A writer's pseudonym is called a pen name, as in the case of Howard O'Brien (who usually writes as “Anne Rice” but sometimes under other names), and an actor's pseudonym is called a stage name, as in the case of Marion Morrison (“John Wayne”). A cadre name may be used for the sake of secrecy by a revolutionary plotter such as Vladimir Ulyanov (“Lenin”) or Iosif Dzhugashvili (“Stalin”).

Conscription has existed at least since ancient Egypt's Old Kingdom (27th century B.C.), though universal conscription has been rare throughout history. Forms of conscription were used by Prussia, Switzerland, Russia, and other European powers in the 17th and 18th centuries. In the U.S., conscription was first applied during the Civil War, by both the North and the South. In the North there were pockets of resistance, and the draft led to riots in several cities.

Inscriptions in the ancient world were always chiseled into stone, as inscriptions still may be today. The principal monument of the Vietnam memorial in Washington, D.C., for instance, is a black wall on which are inscribed the names of all the Americans who died during the war—each name in full, row upon seemingly endless row.

It was the psychologist Sigmund Freud (well, actually his original translator) who put ego into the popular vocabulary, but what he meant by the word is complex, so only other psychologists really use it in the Freudian sense. The rest of us generally use ego simply to mean one's sense of self-worth, whether exaggerated or not. When used in the “exaggerated” sense, ego is almost the same thing as conceit.

As originally used by Aristotle, it referred to a man's character or personality, especially in its balance between passion and caution. Today ethos is used to refer to the practices or values that distinguish one person, organization, or society from others.

According to Freud, the id is the first of these to develop, and is the home of the body's basic instincts, particularly those involving sex and aggression. Since the id lacks logic, reason, or even organization, it can contain conflicting impulses. Primitive in nature, it wants to be satisfied immediately.

Suppose you want to find the average net worth of a group of people—that is, the average value of everything they possess. To find one type of average, called the mean, you'd simply add up the total value of money and property of everyone in the group and divide it by the number of people. To find the other type, called the median, you'd identify the net worth of the person who is richer than half the people and poorer than the other half. So if Warren Buffett drove through a tiny village in India, the mean net worth of those in the village would suddenly rise to perhaps a billion dollars, but their median net worth would remain close to zero.

The mediator tries to bring the two sides to an agreement, but doesn't have the power to actually order such an agreement. Mediators also sometimes have a role in international disputes; when two neighboring countries claim exclusive fishing rights in the same ocean waters, for example, they may invite a trained mediator to help settle the argument. Arbitration is similar to mediation, but in arbitration both parties in a dispute agree to accept the arbitrator's decision.","root":null},{"spell":"intermediary","explain":"A person who works with opposing sides in a dispute in order to bring about an agreement.","sentence":{"text":"The divorce had been bitter, and the two now communicated only through an old friend who they both trusted as an intermediary.","word":null},"detail":"Since inter- means “between, among” (see INTER), an intermediary is someone who moves back and forth in the middle area between two sides—a “go-between.” Mediator (which shares the medi- root) is often a synonym, and so is facilitator; broker and agent are often others. Thus, a real-estate broker or agent shuttles between a house's buyer and seller, who may never even meet each other.

But modern endoscopy required the invention of the electric lightbulb and then fiber-optic cable, so the first modern endoscopes date only to 1967. An endoscope may be inserted through a natural passageway (for example, through the nose or down the esophagus) or through a tiny cut in the skin. A tiny camera with a light at the end of the cable sends back images onto a screen, and the surgeon uses special instruments that work through a tube alongside the cable.

Arthroscopic surgery, or arthroscopy, has revolutionized the treatment of joint injuries. It's performed with an arthroscope, a specialized type of endoscope (see above). A tiny camera and a light are inserted through a small cut in the skin, and through another cut nearby a tiny surgical instrument, controlled through its own cable, is inserted. The surgeon then performs the operation, guided by the images sent back via the fiber-optic cable.

Common laparoscopic surgeries include removal of the gallbladder, appendix, or kidney, and removal of tumors from abdominal organs. Like the other endoscopic surgeries, laparoscopy, as compared to traditional surgery, reduces risk of bleeding, pain following the operation, patient recovery time, and length of hospital stays.","root":null},{"spell":"oscilloscope","explain":"An instrument that shows visual images of changing electrical current on a screen.","sentence":{"text":"An oscilloscope next to the bed was monitoring her vital signs, but otherwise it was hard for a visitor to be sure she was even alive.","word":null},"detail":"In Latin oscillare means “to swing,” and our word oscillation usually means “vibration” or “variation,” especially in a changing flow of electricity. The oscilloscope basically draws a graph of an electrical signal. Since all kinds of physical phenomena can be converted into an electric voltage, oscilloscopes can be used to measure such things as sound, light, and heat. So an oscilloscope can analyze how one clarinet's sound is different from another's, or how one bulb's light differs from another's. Auto mechanics use oscilloscopes to measure engine vibrations; doctors use them to measure brain waves. Audio technicians use oscilloscopes to diagnose problems in audio equipment; TV and radio technicians use them to diagnose TV and radio problems. But oscilloscopes are most essential today to high-tech electronics experimentation.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"TRANS","description":"TRANS comes from Latin to indicate movement “through, across, or beyond” something.

A brief stopover in a town on your way to somewhere else is a transient visit. A summer job on a farm is transient work, lasting only as long as the growing season. You may occasionally experience a transient episode of dizziness or weakness, which vanishes without a trace. As a noun, transient means a person who passes through a place, staying only briefly.

Transfiguration was first used in English as the name of this biblical event, and the Feast of the Transfiguration remains the name of a holy day. So the word has always kept a somewhat religious—and almost always positive—tone. A face may be transfigured by joy, and an “ugly duckling” may be slowly transfigured into a radiant beauty.

Transponders are basic to modern aviation and communications satellites, and they're finding new uses in fields such as medicine as well. But they're now also part of everyday life. The “E-ZPass” that lets you drive right through turnpike tollbooths is a transponder, and the car you're driving may not even start unless it recognizes the signal from your personal key's transponder.

(2) Beyond comprehension; beyond ordinary experience or material existence.","sentence":{"text":"Despite the chaos around her she remained calm, with a transcendent smile on her face.","word":null},"detail":"The Latin verb scandere means “to climb,” so transcend has the basic meaning of climbing so high that you cross some boundary. A transcendent experience is one that takes you out of yourself and convinces you of a larger life or existence; in this sense, it means something close to “spiritual.” The American writers and thinkers known as the Transcendentalists, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, believed in the unity of all creation, the basic goodness of humankind, and the superiority of spiritual vision over mere logic.

Until recently, reactive (in this sense) didn't really have an antonym. So proactive was coined to describe the kind of person who's always looking into the future in order to be prepared for anything. A good parent attempts to be proactive on behalf of his or her children, trying to imagine the problems they might be facing in a few months or years. A company's financial officers study the patterns of the company's earnings to make sure it won't risk running short of cash at any point in the next year or two.

Donating free legal help to those who need it has long been a practice of American law firms; the American Bar Association actually recommends that all lawyers donate 50 hours a year. Pro bono work is sometimes donated by nonlegal firms as well.

A critic might say that a orchestral conductor gave a pro forma performance, since his heart wasn't in it. A business owner might make a pro forma appearance at the funeral of a politician's mother, never having met her but maybe hoping for a favor from her son sometime in the future.

Since they can't be expected to go into effect until the population knows they exist, promulgate has the two meanings “proclaim” and “put into effect.” In ancient Greece and Rome, when most people couldn't read, a new written law would actually be proclaimed in a public place; we've all seen such scenes in historical movies.

It might be spoken by a single actor, maybe playing a god, who would “set the scene” for the audience. Playwrights today instead often provide the same kind of “scene-setting” information through dialogue near the play's beginning; in movies, it may appear (as in the “Star Wars” series) in the form of actual written text. In a nonfiction book, the lead-in is now usually called a preface or introduction; novels rarely provide any introduction at all. Still, prologue remains a useful word for nonliterary purposes.

When you're faced with two things that don't square very well, you may have to reconcile them, the way a scientist might try to reconcile the differing results from two research projects. The U.S. House and Senate, in a process called reconciliation, try to produce one final bill from two different versions that they've passed separately.

So, for example, your English professor might point out the syntactic difference between “Whose woods these are I think I know” and “I think I know whose woods these are”; whereas if the discussion was about diction instead, the question might be about the choice of “woods” rather than “land,” or “think” rather than “bet.”","root":null},{"spell":"synthesize","explain":"To make something by combining different things.","sentence":{"text":"From all the proposals put in front of us, we were asked to synthesize a plan that could get the support of the whole group.","word":null},"detail":"Synthesize is a very common word in chemistry, since chemists are constantly synthesizing new compounds—that is, synthetic compounds— including drugs and industrial chemicals.

So today we have Down syndrome, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Asperger's syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, Tourette's syndrome, sick building syndrome, and many more.

Over time, chimera came to be used for any imaginary monster made up of strange and mismatched parts; today it's the name of several species of truly bizarre-looking fish.

Both terms refer to a hollow goat's horn, or a wicker basket shaped like one, overflowing with produce from the harvest. The cornucopia has been used as a decorative image to represent abundance since at least the 5th century B.C., when it represented a gift given by the infant god Zeus to his beloved nurse: a broken goat's horn that would always magically be filled with whatever she wanted.

By pleasure Epicurus chiefly meant the absence of pain and anxiety. However, over the years Epicureanism has come to mean a delight in fine sensual pleasures, and today an epicure is someone with refined taste, especially in food and wine.

With some poisons, mere skin contact can be lethal; others are lethal when breathed into the lungs in microscopic amounts. To determine if a chemical will be officially called a poison, researchers often use the “LD50” test: If 50 milligrams of the substance for every kilogram of an animal's body weight results in the death of 50% of test animals, the chemical is a poison.

These issues often have to do with quantity; questions about how much of some substance should be considered dangerous, whether in the air or in a soft drink, may be left to toxicologists.

(They also suggested that dollars could be replaced by “energy certificates” representing energy units called ergs.) Today technocrat and technocratic are still popular words for experts with a highly rational and scientific approach to public policy issues.

They're responsible for several nasty conditions, including tetanus, gangrene, botulism, and food poisoning. They often live in deep wounds, so a bad dog bite—or, even worse, a human bite— can be dangerous, since the mouth is full of anaerobic bacteria. But most anaerobic bacteria are harmless, and many are essential to our lives.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"CAD","description":"CAD comes from the Latin verb cadere, “to fall.” Thus, a cascade is usually a waterfall, but sometimes a flood of something else that seems to pour on top of you: a cascade of new problems, a cascade of honors, and so on.","words":[{"spell":"cadaver","explain":"A dead body, especially one that is to be dissected; a corpse.","sentence":{"text":"The cadaver she was given to work on, from the Manhattan morgue, was that of an unclaimed homeless woman.","word":null},"detail":"Since a corpse is a body that has “fallen down dead,” the root cad- seems at home here. For most of us, cadaver has an impersonal sound, and indeed the word is often used for a body whose identity isn't important: most medical students probably don't spend much time wondering who they're dissecting. Someone with cadaverous features looks like a corpse before he or she is dead.","root":null},{"spell":"decadent","explain":"Marked by decay or decline, especially in morals.","sentence":{"text":"The French empire may have been at its most decadent just before the French Revolution.","word":null},"detail":"To be decadent is to be in the process of decay, so a powerful nation may be said to be in a decadent stage if its power is fading. But the word is more often used to speak of moral decay. Ever since the Roman empire, we've tended to link Rome's fall to the moral decay of its ruling class, who indulged in extreme luxuries and unwholesome pleasures while providing the public with cruel spectacles such as the slaughter of the gladiators. But not everyone agrees on what moral decadence looks like (or even how it might have hastened the fall of Rome), though most people think it involves too many sensual pleasures—as, for instance, among the French and English poets and artists of the 1880s and '90s called the Decadents. These days, for some reason, people have decided decadent is the way to describe rich chocolate cakes.","root":null},{"spell":"cadence","explain":"(1) The close of a musical phrase, especially one that moves to a harmonic point of rest. (2) The rhythmic flow of sound in language.","sentence":{"text":"As the piano came to a cadence, the singer ascended to a beautiful high note, which she held for several seconds until the piano came in again in a new key.","word":null},"detail":"Most of us hear the ending of a piece of music as a fall to a resting place, even if the melody ends on a high note. And that's the way endings were being heard way back in the 16th century, when cadence first began to be used in English for musical endings. Most cadences are harmonic “formulas” (standard harmonic patterns that we've all heard thousands of times) and we don't expect them to be original; so whether you're consciously aware of it or not, a cadential passage is usually quite recognizable. When cadence means “speech rhythm,” its cad- root refers to the way the accents “fall.”","root":null},{"spell":"cadenza","explain":"A virtuosic flourish or extended passage by a soloist, often improvised, that occurs shortly before the end of a piece or movement.","sentence":{"text":"Each of her arias was greeted with greater applause, but it was the brilliant improvised cadenza of her final number that brought down the house.","word":null},"detail":"A concerto is a large piece for an instrumental soloist (usually playing piano or violin) and orchestra. Concertos are often extremely demanding for the soloist, but the most difficult part of all may be the cadenza, when the orchestra drops out completely, leaving the soloist to dazzle the audience with a set of flourishes, often completely original, right before a movement ends. Cadenzas are also heard in many vocal arias, especially those of the 18th century. The word, borrowed from Italian, originally meant “cadence”; thus, the cadenza, even if it lasts for a couple of minutes, is essentially a decoration of the final important harmonic cadence of the piece.","root":null}]},{"unit":null,"name":"TRIB","description":"TRIB comes from the Latin tribuere, meaning “to give” or “to pay.” So a group that distributes food passes it out to those in need, and when you contribute to the group you give your money or energy to it.","words":[{"spell":"tribute","explain":"(1) Something (such as a gift or speech) that is given or performed to show appreciation, respect, or affection. (2) Something that proves the good quality or effectiveness of something.","sentence":{"text":"Near the end of his speech, he paid tribute to the two pioneers in the field who were in the audience.","word":null},"detail":"Tribute originally took the form of things given from a weaker group to the dominant power of a region—a bit like the “protection money” the Mafia gets from small businesses after making them offers they can't refuse, though the older form of tribute actually did buy the weaker group some protection from enemy forces. Tribute could come in the form of valuables, cattle, or even produce, and might include the loan of warriors to strengthen the ruler's army. But when we “pay tribute” today, it's generally in the form of praise. And when we say, for instance, that a successful school “is a tribute to” the vision of its founder, we mean that its success is itself a form of praise for the person who founded it. And a “tribute band” is a rock group intended to honor a great band of the past.","root":null},{"spell":"tributary","explain":"A stream flowing into a larger stream or a lake.","sentence":{"text":"The entire expedition had perished of fever attempting to reach the source of one of the Amazon's great tributaries.","word":null},"detail":"A tributary was originally a person or state that owed tribute to a more powerful person or state. Ancient China, for instance, had dozens of tributary states, and the emperor would receive elephants from Siam or young girls from Korea as tribute. Just as a smaller power gave some of its wealth to a larger power, a small river contributes its waters to a larger one. A tributary can be a tiny stream, but some are immense rivers. The Missouri River, for example, could be called a tributary to the Mississippi, even though it's about 2,500 miles long and receives hundreds of tributaries itself.","root":null},{"spell":"attribute","explain":"(1) To explain by indicating a cause. (2) To regard as likely to be a quality of a person or thing.","sentence":{"text":"He attributed his long life to a good sense of humor and a glass of wine with lunch and dinner every day.","word":null},"detail":"Attribute means something rather similar to “pay tribute.” So, for example, an award winner who pays tribute to an inspiring professor is, in a sense, attributing her success to the professor. Though if you attribute your fear of dogs to an incident in your childhood, you're not exactly praising the nasty dog that bit you way back when. The second sense of attribute is slightly different: If you attribute bad motives to a politician, it means you think he or she is doing things for the wrong reasons (even if you don't have any proof). When attribute is accented on its first syllable, it's being used as a noun, usually as a synonym for quality. So, for instance, you may believe that an even temper is an attribute of the best presidents, or that cheerfulness is your spouse's best attribute.","root":null},{"spell":"retribution","explain":"Something given in payment for a wrong; punishment.","sentence":{"text":"The victims' families have been clamoring for retribution, sometimes even interrupting the trial proceedings.","word":null},"detail":"With its prefix re-, meaning “back,” retribution means literally “payback.” And indeed we usually use it when talking about personal revenge, whether it's retribution for an insult in a high-school corridor or retribution for a guerrilla attack on a government building. But retribution isn't always so personal: God takes “divine retribution” on humans several times in the Old Testament, especially in the great Flood that wipes out almost the entire human race. And retribution for criminal acts, usually in the form of a prison sentence, is taken by the state, not the victims.","root":null}]}],"specialSection":[{"spell":"halcyon","explain":"(1) Calm and peaceful. (2) Happy and successful.","sentence":{"text":"She looks back fondly on those halcyon childhood days when she and her sisters seemed to inhabit a magical world where it was always summer.","word":null},"detail":"For the Greeks, the halcyon was a bird (probably the kingfisher) that was believed to nest on the Mediterranean Sea around the beginning of winter, and had the power to quiet the rough December waters around Sicily for about two weeks—the “halcyon days.” Thus the adjective halcyon came to mean calm and serene. Today people especially use it to describe a golden time in their past.","root":null},{"spell":"meander","explain":"(1) To follow a winding course. (2) To wander slowly without a specific purpose or direction.","sentence":{"text":"A little-used trail meanders through the mountains, crossed by cowpaths onto which hikers often stray and get lost.","word":null},"detail":"Now and then, geography contributes an ordinary word to the language. The Greek word maiandros came from the Maiandros River (now the Menderes River) in western Turkey, which rises in the mountains and flows 240 miles into the Aegean Sea. Meandering is a natural tendency especially in slow- moving rivers on flat ground with fine-grained sand, and the Maiandros was well known for its many windings and wanderings. Roads and trails, like rivers, can be said to meander, but so can relaxed music, lazy writing, and idle thoughts.","root":null},{"spell":"oedipal","explain":"Relating to an intense emotional relationship with one's mother and conflict with one's father.","sentence":{"text":"Already on her first visit she sensed a tense oedipal situation, with her boyfriend and his father barely getting through dinner without coming to blows.","word":null},"detail":"In Greek mythology, the king of Thebes, in response to a dreadful prophecy, abandoned his infant son Oedipus, who was then brought up by shepherds. Grown to manhood, Oedipus slew his father almost accidentally, not recognizing him, and then married his mother. When the shameful truth was discovered, the mother committed suicide and Oedipus blinded himself and went into exile. The psychiatrist Sigmund Freud invented the term Oedipus complex to mean a sexual desire that a child normally feels toward the parent of the opposite sex, along with jealous feelings toward the parent of the same sex. In Freud's theory (not accepted by everyone today), lingering oedipal feelings are an essential source of adult personality disorder, and can result in choosing a spouse who closely resembles your father or mother.","root":null},{"spell":"ostracize","explain":"To exclude someone from a group by common consent .","sentence":{"text":"Back in the 1950s she had been ostracized by her fellow country-club members for her radical political beliefs.","word":null},"detail":"In the ancient democracy of Athens, citizens were permitted to vote once a year to exile anyone who they thought might pose a problem to the city-state. The man with the most votes was banished for ten years, even if no one had ever made a single charge against him. Voting was done on ostraka—bits of broken pottery, the Greek equivalent of scrap paper—and the process was known as ostrakizein. Today the most common kind of ostracism is exclusion from a social group. It can be especially painful in school: no more sleepovers, no more party invitations, just lots of whispering behind your back.","root":null},{"spell":"paean","explain":"(1) A song of joy, praise, tribute, or triumph. (2) A work that praises or honors its subject.","sentence":{"text":"At his retirement party, the beloved president was treated to paeans from friends and employees to his years at the head of the company.","word":null},"detail":"Originally in ancient Greece, a paian was a choral hymn to Apollo as the god of healing. More generally, it could be a hymn of thanksgiving, as when, in Homer's Iliad, the followers of Achilles sing a paean on the death of his enemy Hector. Paeans could be sung at banquets, at public funerals, to armies departing for battle and fleets leaving the harbor, and in celebrations of military victories.","root":null},{"spell":"philippic","explain":"A speech full of bitter condemnation; a tirade.","sentence":{"text":"Every few days he launches another philippic against teenagers: their ridiculous clothes, their abominable manners, their ghastly music.","word":null},"detail":"In 351–350 B.C., the great Greek orator Demosthenes delivered a series of speeches against King Philip II of Macedon, the so-called philippikoi logoi (“speeches regarding Philip”). Three centuries later, in 44–43 B.C., the great Roman orator Cicero delivered a series of speeches against Mark Antony, which soon became known as the philippica or orationes philippicae, since they were modeled on Demosthenes' attacks. Splendid though both men's speeches were, Demosthenes was eventually exiled by the Macedonians, and Cicero was executed at Mark Antony's orders.","root":null},{"spell":"satyr","explain":"A man with a strong desire for many women.","sentence":{"text":"Still drinking and womanizing at the age of 70, he likes to think of himself as a satyr rather than an old goat.","word":null},"detail":"Satyrs, the minor forest gods of Greek mythology, had the face, torso, and arms of a man, the ears and tail of a goat, and two goatlike legs. Fond of the pleasures associated with Dionysus (or Bacchus), the god of wine, they were full of playful and sometimes violent energies, and spent much of their time chasing the beautiful nature spirits known as nymphs. Satyrs show up over and over in ancient art. The Greek god Pan, with his reed pipes and mischievous delight in life, had the appearance and character of a satyr but greater powers. Notice how satyr is pronounced; it's quite different from satire.","root":null},{"spell":"zealot","explain":"A fanatical supporter.","sentence":{"text":"My girlfriend's father is a religious zealot, so I always find excuses not to have dinner at their house.","word":null},"detail":"In the 1st century A.D., a fanatical sect arose in Judaea to oppose the Roman domination of Palestine. Known as the Zealots, they fought their most famous battle at the great fortress of Masada, where 1,000 defenders took their own lives just as the Romans were about to storm the fort. Over the years, zealot came to mean anyone who is passionately devoted to a cause. The adjective zealous may describe someone who's merely dedicated and energetic (“a zealous investigator,” “zealous about combating inflation,” etc.). But zealot (like its synonym fanatic) and zealotry (like its synonym fanaticism) are used disapprovingly—even while Jews everywhere still honor the memory of those who died at Masada.","root":null}],"quizzes":[]}]

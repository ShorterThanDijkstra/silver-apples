# The Song of Wandering Aengus

BY WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS

<section>
<br>
<p>
I went out to the hazel wood,<br>
Because a fire was in my head,<br>
And cut and peeled a hazel wand,<br>
And hooked a berry to a thread;<br>
And when white moths were on the wing,<br>
And moth-like stars were flickering out,<br>
I dropped the berry in a stream<br>
And caught a little silver trout.<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
When I had laid it on the floor<br>
I went to blow the fire a-flame,<br>
But something rustled on the floor,<br>
And someone called me by my name:<br>
It had become a glimmering girl<br>
With apple blossom in her hair<br>
Who called me by my name and ran<br>
And faded through the brightening air.<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Though I am old with wandering<br>
Through hollow lands and hilly lands,<br>
I will find out where she has gone,<br>
And kiss her lips and take her hands;<br>
And walk among long dappled grass,<br>
And pluck till time and times are done,<br>
The silver apples of the moon,<br>
The golden apples of the sun.<br>
</p>
